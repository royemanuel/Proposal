@article{North2005,
abstract = {North begins his book by stating that “institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction.”(3) That being said North then proposes to examine institutions, changes in them, and their impact on economic performance over time. He has divided the book into three parts. Part I is the examination of the nature of institutions and their manifestations for economic performance. From there, Part II outlines the theory of institutional change and how it explains how past behaviors influence present and future behaviors. It also explores the impact of incremental changes within institutions and its effect on the nature of path dependence. Part III is the primary objective of the North’s work. It is to understand the differential performances of various economies through time. The author is careful to make the distinction between institutions and organizations. Both are components of the structural framework that supports human interaction but they are not the same. As stated previously, institutions can be considered the rules of the game and organizations can be considered the players. The purpose of the rules is to define the way that the game is played. Organizations are groups of individuals who work toward a common goal or objective and have common interests. Political parties, churches, schools, unions, or government agencies are some examples of organizations. The book considers organizations primarily as the agent for institutional change with emphasis on the interaction between the rules (institutions) and the players (organizations). North contends that any theory on institutions must be based on human behaviors since all institutions are created and changed by humans. Understanding that the major role of institutions in a society is to reduce uncertainty by establishing a stable structure to human interaction this study attempts to answer the questions.},

@inproceedings{Chang2015,
abstract = {In current practice, economic analysis of disaster risk reduction often neglects time-dependent losses such as business interruption and income losses that accrue over time during post-disaster recovery. This paper argues that incorporating time-dependent losses is critical to making investment decisions that foster disaster resilience. Drawing from the previous empirical and modeling work, the paper argues that incorporating economic impacts of short-term service outage and restoration is relatively straightforward and can be reeadily accomplished under certain assumptions -- most notably, assumptions of stable economic structure. Economic recovery is complex and highly context-dependent, however, and will remain very challenging to model, particularly for catastrophic events. To illustrate these points, examples are drawn from several cases in the U.S., Japan, and New Zealand.},

abstract = {Revised and updated second edition with new material Text for a transition course between calculus and more advanced analysis courses Contains new material on topics such as irrationality of pi, the Baire category theorem, Newton's method and the secant method, and continuous nowhere-differentiable functions Includes new examples and improved proofs For over three decades, this best-selling classic has been used by thousands of students in the United States and abroad as a must-have textbook for a transitional course from calculus to analysis. It has proven to be very useful for mathematics majors who have no previous experience with rigorous proofs. Its friendly style unlocks the mystery of writing proofs, while carefully examining the theoretical basis for calculus. Proofs are given in full, and the large number of well-chosen examples and exercises range from routine to challenging. The second edition preserves the book’s clear and concise style, illuminating discussions, and simple, well-motivated proofs. New topics include material on the irrationality of pi, the Baire category theorem, Newton's method and the secant method, and continuous nowhere-differentiable functions. Review from the first edition: "This book is intended for the student who has a good, but na{\"{\i}}ve, understanding of elementary calculus and now wishes to gain a thorough understanding of a few basic concepts in analysis.... The author has tried to write in an informal but precise style, stressing motivation and methods of proof, and ... has succeeded admirably." —MATHEMATICAL REVIEWS},

MBSE focuses the system engineering process on system modeling. Thus, requirements derivation, system design, integration, verification, and validation activities all center around the model of the system. System models can be built in many ways. This paper presents an approach using DoDAF. Visual accessibility of the DoDAF views facilitates full participation by all system stakeholders, including the customers, developers, and implementers, and enables the necessary dialogue. The approach promotes communications among the members of the development team and speeds up the iterations of the systems engineering process. The paper illustrates the utility of the DoDAF artifacts by means of a simplified but comprehensive, easy to follow, illustrative example.},

The paper presents a supply chain simulation study for a real case concerned with the Portuguese automotive supply chain. The subset automotive supply chain involved in the case study is a three-echelon supply chain, composed by one automaker, two 1st-tier suppliers, two 2nd-tier suppliers, and one outsource entity. The purpose of the study is to evaluate alternative supply chain scenarios for improving supply chain resilience to a disturbance and understanding how mitigation strategies affect each supply chain entity performance. Two strategies widely used to mitigate disturbance negative effects on supply chains were considered and six scenarios were designed. The scenarios differ in terms of presence or absence of a disturbance in one hand and presence or absence of a mitigation strategy in other hand. To evaluate the scenarios designed, two performance measures were defined per supply chain entity, Lead Time Ratio and Total Cost.},

@article{Huang2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, evidence remains conflicting. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate this association. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Medline and Embase databases for case-control studies evaluating the association between the VDR Apa-I, Bsm-I, Fok-I, Taq-I polymorphisms and MS risk. Data were extracted using standardized forms and odds ratios (OR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: 11 case-control studies involving a total of 2599 cases and 2816 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Available data did not suggest an association between any of the VDR polymorphisms and the risk for MS. For Taq-I, which is the most investigated VDR polymorphism with 8 studies (2472 cases and 2446 controls), the combined OR was 1.12 (95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.26) for the dominant model (tt+Tt vs. TT), 1.03(95{\%} CI: 0.88-1.20) for the recessive model (tt vs. Tt+TT), and 1.04 (95{\%} CI: 0.78-1.38) for the homozygote model (tt vs. TT). ORs for other VDR polymorphisms were similar. CONCLUSION: The VDR Apa-I, Bsm-I, Fok-I and Taq-I polymorphisms are not associated with MS risk.},

This report describes how tactics are based on the parameters of quality attribute models. Tactics provide an architectural means of adjusting those parameters, which, in turn, can improve the quality-attribute-specific behavior of the resulting system. This report justifies the tactics for modifiability, using established concepts of coupling, cohesion, and cost motivations as the means of identifying parameters of interest. Various tactics are then described based on their ability to control these parameters. The report also describes a standard set of architectural patterns and their variants in terms of the use of these tactics.},

Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields.},

@article{Sotarauta2006,
abstract = {The great debates of most fields associated with economic development rest on emergence versus intention and the interplay between the two. The 'residual' of unexplained divergence between goal and outcome, in this sense, can be ascribed in part to the interplay, or co-evolution, between policies (intention) and self-organizing (emergent) development. Do public policy and economic development co-evolve in technologically innovative economies, and if so, how? This paper discusses the basic premise that the gap between economic development strategies and their poor implementation cannot simply be removed by creating better-intended strategies, tools or institutions. The analysis uses evolutionary thinking for an analysis of economic development, and ends with some postulates for future study on innovative regions and the concept of resilience. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, an indicator of network resilience is defined that quantifies the ability of an intermodal freight transport network to recover from disruptions due to natural or human-caused disaster. The indicator considers the network's inherent ability to cope with the negative consequences of disruptions as a result of its topological and operational attributes. Furthermore, the indicator explicitly accounts for the impact of potential recovery activities that might be taken in the immediate aftermath of the disruption to meet target operational service levels while adhering to a fixed budget. A stochastic mixed-integer program is proposed for quantifying network resilience and identifying an optimal postevent course of action (i.e., set of activities) to take. To solve this mathematical program, a technique that accounts for dependencies in random link attributes based on concepts of Benders decomposition, column generation, and Monte Carlo simulation is proposed. Experiments were conducted to illustrate the resilience concept and procedure for its measurement, and to assess the role of network topology in its magnitude.},

abstract = {The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction reported that the 2011 natural disasters, including the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, resulted in {\$}366 billion in direct damages and 29,782 fatalities worldwide. Storms and floods accounted for up to 70{\%} of the 302 natural disasters worldwide in 2011, with earthquakes producing the greatest number of fatalities. Average annual losses in the United States amount to about {\$}55 billion. Enhancing community and system resilience could lead to massive savings through risk reduction and expeditious recovery. The rational management of such reduction and recovery is facilitated by an appropriate definition of resilience and associated metrics. In this article, a resilience definition is provided that meets a set of requirements with clear relationships to the metrics of the relevant abstract notions of reliability and risk. Those metrics also meet logically consistent requirements drawn from measure theory, and provide a sound basis for the development of effective decision-making tools for multihazard environments. Improving the resiliency of a system to meet target levels requires the examination of system enhancement alternatives in economic terms, within a decision-making framework. Relevant decision analysis methods would typically require the examination of resilience based on its valuation by society at large. The article provides methods for valuation and benefit-cost analysis based on concepts from risk analysis and management.},

This paper considers a problem in which an enemy attempts to maximize flow through a capacitated network while an interdictor tries to minimize this maximum flow by interdicting (stopping flow on) network arcs using limited resources. This problem is shown to be NP-complete even when the interdiction of an arc requires exactly one unit of resource. New, flexible, integer programming models are developed for the problem and its variations and valid inequalities and a reformulation are derived to tighten the LP relaxations of some of these models. A small computational example from the literature illustrates a hybrid (partly directed and partly undirected) model and the usefulness of the valid inequalities and the reformulation.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the contribution value of biodiversity to ecosystem performances under a viability approach. Two contrasted cases are considered. First, a no-exploitation situation where the ecosystem performances are measured through the capacity of species richness to maintain the ecosystem above a minimum ecological viability threshold measured through a Shannon index. Second, an exploitation situation where the performances of the ecosystem are measured through its economic sustainability, that is, its capacity to generate direct-use values greater than a minimum guaranteed utility level. The analysis, based on numerical simulations, shows that biodiversity has a positive effect on both ecological and economic performances and that in both cases the marginal contribution of biodiversity is positive. Furthermore, this marginal contribution exhibits maximum values. These maximum values seem however to decrease with the level of species richness. These results show interesting links with two of the main current debates on biodiversity: the Noah's Ark problem and the assumption of decreasing marginal value supported by some recent works on bio-prospecting. © 2008.},

abstract = {This article develops a quantitative all-hazards framework for critical asset and portfolio risk analysis (CAPRA) that considers both natural and human-caused hazards. Following a discussion on the nature of security threats, the need for actionable risk assessments, and the distinction between asset and portfolio-level analysis, a general formula for all-hazards risk analysis is obtained that resembles the traditional model based on the notional product of consequence, vulnerability, and threat, though with clear meanings assigned to each parameter. Furthermore, a simple portfolio consequence model is presented that yields first-order estimates of interdependency effects following a successful attack on an asset. Moreover, depending on the needs of the decisions being made and available analytical resources, values for the parameters in this model can be obtained at a high level or through detailed systems analysis. Several illustrative examples of the CAPRA methodology are provided.},

Such pitfalls include double counting, ignoring post-disaster liabilities, ignoring non-market losses (e.g. recreation, loss of leisure, damage to historic sites and cultural assets, etc.), ignoring the needs of the end user, and questions as to how indirect/systemic losses might be modeled. With one exception, much of what is discussed in the paper is based on off-the-shelf economics and will not prove to be contentious. Regional economists are likely to have different opinions as to how to best model indirect and systemic loss; it is this that will lead to a lively debate as to how to proceed. Assessments of economic fallout from the World Trade Center attack are used to illustrate some of the problems reported in this paper.},

abstract = {A supply chain network design needs to consider the future probability of reconfiguration due to some problems of disaster or price changes. The objective of this article is to design a reconfigurable supply chain network by optimizing inventory allocation and transportation routing. A two-stage programming is composed according to Benders decomposition by allocating inventory in advance and anticipating the changes of transportation routings; thus the transportation routing is stochastic in nature. In addition, the fuzzy shortest path is developed to solve the problem complexity in terms of the multi-criteria of lead time and capacity with an efficient computational method. The results and analysis indicate that the proposed two-stage programming with fuzzy shortest path surpasses the performance of shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraint (SPPTWCC) in terms of less computational time and CPU memory consumption. Finally, management decision-making is discussed among other concluding remarks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the last decade 'sectoral systems of innovation' have emerged as a new approach in innovation studies. This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The first recorded usage of the word reliability dates back to the 1800s, albeit referred to a person and not a technical system. Since then, the concept of reliability has become a pervasive attribute worth of both qualitative and quantitative connotations. In particular, the revolutionary social, cultural and technological changes that have occurred from the 1800s to the 2000s have contributed to the need for a rational framework and quantitative treatment of the reliability of engineered systems and plants. This has led to the rise of reliability engineering as a scientific discipline. In this paper, some considerations are shared with respect to a number of problems and challenges which researchers and practitioners in reliability engineering are facing when analyzing today's complex systems. The focus will be on the contribution of reliability to system safety and on its role within system risk analysis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Funtowicz and Ravetz model for classifying problem-solving strategies into applied sciences, professional consultancy, and postnormal sciences is well known in the social science risk literature. The model is illustrated in a diagram based on the two axes: (i) decision stakes-the value dimension (costs, benefits) and (ii) the system uncertainties-the knowledge dimension. These axes resemble the same two dimensions that characterize some recently developed risk perspectives: (a) consequences and the severity of these consequences and (b) associated uncertainties. In this article, we make a detailed comparison of these two types of risk frameworks. We point to similarities and differences in motivation and use. A main conclusion of the article is that these risk perspectives all provide adequate scientific bases for the Funtowicz and Ravetz model. New insights are provided on the understanding of what the outcome stakes/consequences and uncertainty dimensions really capture in these perspectives and frameworks.},

abstract = {Traditional probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), of the type originally developed for engineered systems, is still proposed for terrorism risk analysis. We show that such PRA applications are unjustified in general. The capacity of terrorists to seek and use information and to actively research different attack options before deciding what to do raises unique features of terrorism risk assessment that are not adequately addressed by conventional PRA for natural and engineered systems-in part because decisions based on such PRA estimates do not adequately hedge against the different probabilities that attackers may eventually act upon. These probabilities may differ from the defender's (even if the defender's experts are thoroughly trained, well calibrated, unbiased probability assessors) because they may be conditioned on different information. We illustrate the fundamental differences between PRA and terrorism risk analysis, and suggest use of robust decision analysis for risk management when attackers may know more about some attack options than we do.},

multistate system reliability analysis to incorporate common-cause
failures (CCF). An implicit 2-stage approach is used. In stage {\#}1, a
polynomial representation of system-output performance distribution is
obtained without considering system elements which are subject to CCF.
In stage {\#}2, the contribution of CCF is correctly included based on
information stored in vector-indicators that describe states of system
elements belonging to various common-cause groups. A straightforward
procedure is suggested for evaluating reliability functions of
nonrepairable series-parallel multistate systems with CCF. This
procedure allows the reliability functions to be obtained numerically.
Examples are given},

@article{Chassin2013,
abstract = {Nearly fourteen years ago the Institute of Medicine's report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, triggered a national movement to improve patient safety. Despite the substantial and concentrated efforts that followed, quality and safety problems in health care continue to routinely result in harm to patients. Desired progress will not be achieved unless substantial changes are made to the way in which quality improvement is conducted. Alongside important efforts to eliminate preventable complications of care, there must also be an effort to seriously address the widespread overuse of health services. That overuse, which places patients at risk of harm and wastes resources at the same time, has been almost entirely left out of recent quality improvement endeavors. Newer and much more effective strategies and tools are needed to address the complex quality challenges confronting health care. Tools such as Lean, Six Sigma, and change management are proving highly effective in tackling problems as difficult as hand-off communication failures and patient falls. Finally, the organizational culture of most American hospitals and other health care organizations must change. To create a culture of safety, leaders must eliminate intimidating behaviors that suppress the reporting of errors and unsafe conditions. Leaders must also hold everyone accountable for adherence to safe practices.},

However, little is known of the extent to which the lean philosophy matches the nature of those systems, which have different characteristics of complexity in comparison with manufacturing plants, in which LP was originated. This article analyses the extent to which LP is compatible with the nature of complex systems, as a basis for the identification of learning opportunities for LP from complex systems theory (CST). As a framework for this analysis, both the prescriptions from LP and CST for designing systems are compared in terms of their potential impact on a set of characteristics of complex systems. Examples of how LP may learn from CST are identified as well as examples of how CST may help to tackle common difficulties in LP implementation. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract = {This paper revisits the important result of the real options approach to investment under uncertainty, which states that increased uncertainty raises the value of waiting and thus decelerates investment. Typically in this literature projects are assumed to be perpetual. However, in today's economy firms face a fast-changing technology environment, implying that investment projects are usually considered to have a finite life. The present paper studies investment projects with finite project life, and we find that, in contrast with the existing theory, investments may be accelerated by increased uncertainty. It is shown that this particularly happens at low levels of uncertainty and when project life is short. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dominkovics2008,
abstract = {In this paper, the usability of fractal description of dendrites in failure analysis is discussed. Dendrites grow during electrochemical migration (ECM) causing failures in the form of short circuits between conductive wirings and leads in microcircuit interconnection and packaging elements, especially on printed wiring boards (PWBs). The parameters of the dendrite growth process are influenced by functional (electrical) and environmental conditions as well as by the material composition of metallization stripes and surface finishes. Mathematically, dendrites can be described as fractals and therefore they can be characterized with fractal dimension values calculated by various computerized pattern processing methods. We have found relationship between chemical composition of surface finishes and fractal dimensions of dendrites grown from them. This hypothesis has been proved in three steps: first, dendrites were grown by simple water drop test (WDT) series in order to get good quality, reproducible test specimens; in the second step, optical photomicrographs were taken from the dendrite structures and finally these micrographs were analyzed using computerized algorithms. The result is that fractal dimensions are material specific and so they can be used to describe the material composition. This is not only an important theoretical result in understanding dendrite growth mechanisms, but it also has a useful practical aspect: short detection and optical inspection can be combined with simple calculations to identify materials involved into electrochemical migration failures without making more complicated elemental chemical analysis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Natural disasters in 2011 alone resulted in {\$}366 billion (2011 US{\$}) in direct damages and 29,782 fatalities worldwide. Storms and floods accounted for up to 70{\%} of the 302 natural disasters worldwide, with earthquakes producing the greatest number of fatalities. Man- aging these risks rationally requires an appropriate definition of resilience and associated metrics. This paper provides a resilience definition that meets a set of requirements with clear relationships to reliability and risk as key relevant metrics. The resilience definition proposed is of the intension type, which is of the highest order. Resilience metrics are reviewed, and simplified ones are proposed to meet logically con- sistent requirements drawn from measure theory. Such metrics provide a sound basis for the development of effective decision-making tools for multihazard environments. The paper also examines recovery, with its classifications based on level, spatial, and temporal considerations. Three case studies are developed and used to gain insights to help define recovery profiles. Two recovery profiles, linear and step functions, are introduced. Computational examples and parametric analysis illustrate the reasonableness of the metrics proposed.},

@article{Chassin2013a,
abstract = {CONTEXT: Despite serious and widespread efforts to improve the quality of health care, many patients still suffer preventable harm every day. Hospitals find improvement difficult to sustain, and they suffer "project fatigue" because so many problems need attention. No hospitals or health systems have achieved consistent excellence throughout their institutions. High-reliability science is the study of organizations in industries like commercial aviation and nuclear power that operate under hazardous conditions while maintaining safety levels that are far better than those of health care. Adapting and applying the lessons of this science to health care offer the promise of enabling hospitals to reach levels of quality and safety that are comparable to those of the best high-reliability organizations.

METHODS: We combined the Joint Commission's knowledge of health care organizations with knowledge from the published literature and from experts in high-reliability industries and leading safety scholars outside health care. We developed a conceptual and practical framework for assessing hospitals' readiness for and progress toward high reliability. By iterative testing with hospital leaders, we refined the framework and, for each of its fourteen components, defined stages of maturity through which we believe hospitals must pass to reach high reliability.

FINDINGS: We discovered that the ways that high-reliability organizations generate and maintain high levels of safety cannot be directly applied to today's hospitals. We defined a series of incremental changes that hospitals should undertake to progress toward high reliability. These changes involve the leadership's commitment to achieving zero patient harm, a fully functional culture of safety throughout the organization, and the widespread deployment of highly effective process improvement tools.

CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals can make substantial progress toward high reliability by undertaking several specific organizational change initiatives. Further research and practical experience will be necessary to determine the validity and effectiveness of this framework for high-reliability health care.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for integrated probabilistic risk assessment where exposure assessment and hazard characterization are both included in a probabilistic way. The aim is to specify the probability that a random individual from a defined (sub)population will have an exposure high enough to cause a particular health effect of a predefined magnitude, the critical effect size (CES). The exposure level that results in exactly that CES in a particular person is that person's individual critical effect dose (ICED). Individuals in a population typically show variation, both in their individual exposure (IEXP) and in their ICED. Both the variation in IEXP and the variation in ICED are quantified in the form of probability distributions. Assuming independence between both distributions, they are combined (by Monte Carlo) into a distribution of the individual margin of exposure (IMoE). The proportion of the IMoE distribution below unity is the probability of critical exposure (PoCE) in the particular (sub)population. Uncertainties involved in the overall risk assessment (i.e., both regarding exposure and effect assessment) are quantified using Monte Carlo and bootstrap methods. This results in an uncertainty distribution for any statistic of interest, such as the probability of critical exposure (PoCE). The method is illustrated based on data for the case of dietary exposure to the organophosphate acephate. We present plots that concisely summarize the probabilistic results, retaining the distinction between variability and uncertainty. We show how the relative contributions from the various sources of uncertainty involved may be quantified.},

This framework relies on the complementary measures of resilience: ‘‘Reduced failure probabilities,’’ ‘‘Reduced consequences from failures,’’ and ‘‘Reduced time to recovery.’’ The framework also includes quantitative measures of the ‘‘ends’’ of robustness and rapidity, and the ‘‘means’’ of resourcefulness and redundancy, and integrates those measures into the four dimensions of com- munity resilience—technical, organizational, social, and economic—all of which can be used to quantify measures of resilience for various types of physical and organizational systems. Systems diagrams then establish the tasks required to achieve these objectives. This framework can be useful in future research to determine the resiliency of different units of analysis and systems, and to develop resiliency targets and detailed analytical procedures to generate these values.},

@article{Yavari2002,
abstract = {In this paper we study the mechanical attributes of the fractal nature of fracture surfaces. The structure of stress and strain singularity at the tip of a fractal crack, which can be self-similar or self-affine, is studied. The three classical modes of fracture and the fourth mode of fracture are discussed for fractal cracks in twodimensional and three- dimensional solid bodies. It is discovered that there are six modes of fracture in fractal fracture mechanics. The J -integral is shown to be path-dependent. It is explained that the proposed modified J - integrals in the literature that are argued to be path-independent are only locally path-independent and have no physical meaning. It is conjectured that a fractal J -integral should be the rate of potential energy release per unit of a fractal measure of crack growth. The powers of stress and strain singularities at the tip of a fractal crack in a strain-hardening material are calculated. It is shown that stresses and strains have weaker singularities at the tip of a fractal crack than they do at the tip of a smooth crack.},

But no loss can actually destroy more than the entire value of a bank or of a company, and this upper bound should be taken into consideration when dealing with tail-risk assessment. In financial risk management no risk can really be infinite, given that it always exists an upper bound, no matter how big. Introducing what we call the dual distribution, we show how to deal with heavy-tailed phenomena with a remote yet finite upper bound. We show how to compute relevant tail quantities like the Value-at-Risk (V aR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). Our methodology is useful with apparently infinite-mean phenomena, as in the case of operational risk, but it can be applied in all those situations involving fat-tails and bounded supports.},

@article{Kontogiannis2013,
abstract = {The continued growth of civil aviation and the introduction of new air traffic management systems have increased the complexity of the system, hence requiring more adaptable patterns of control and coordination. There is a need to look deeper into the patterns of control, the transfer of control and coordination across boundaries or sectors and the adaptation to unexpected scenarios that may contribute to ‘loss of control’ events. To this end, this article elaborates on the extended control model (Hollnagel and Woods 2005) and complements a functional description of the air traffic control (ATC) system with several strategies required in ‘being in control’ of the joint cognitive system. Reviews of the literature, field studies and observations of performance in ATC have been used to model ‘loss of control’ events as problems in adapting control strategies in order to (1) maintain control of actions, (2) transfer control, (3) coordinate and (4) choose new modes of functioning and recovery when control breaks down. These control aspects are useful for debriefing controllers after critical events and identifying system performance flaws that can provide input to ergonomic interventions, such as the design of new air traffic management systems, decision aids and role allocation.},

Surprisingly, the interregnum between successive generations has received little attention. To understand what happens in the interregnum, we study the transition from 2G to 3G in mobile communications. Our study identifies the presence of forces for both change and continuity across heterogeneous social and technical elements shaping an uneven transition between 2G and 3G mobile communications technology platforms. Unanticipated misalignments and asynchronies that emerged during the journey shifted the incentives of the various actors involved to participate. Based on these observations, we offer several conjectures as to the dynamics that can give rise to temporal discords during inter-generational technological transitions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An important role of system designers is to effectively explore the tradespace of alternatives when making design decisions during concept phase. As systems become more complex, formal methods to enable good design decisions are essential; this can be empowered through a tradespace exploration paradigm. This paper demonstrates the use of the Pareto Trace and associated metrics to identify system alternatives across tradespaces with high degrees of passive value robustness—alternatives that continue to deliver value to stakeholders in spite of changes in needs (attributes) or context. A value-driven tradespace approach is used to represent the baseline performance versus cost of a large number of system alternatives. The classical notion of Pareto Set is extended to identify alternatives and their characteristics that lead to their inclusion in Pareto Sets across changing contexts. Using a low earth orbiting satellite case example, five types of context changes are used to demonstrate this method: 1) addition or subtraction of attributes; 2) change in the priorities of attributes; 3) change in single attribute utility function shapes; 4) change in multiattribute utility aggregation function; and 5) addition of new decision maker. This approach demonstrates the ability for system designers to pose questions about assessment of alternatives during early conceptual design. Suggestions for application of Pareto Trace beyond the case example are discussed and presented, including application of a “fuzziness” factor and statistical measures. In particular, distinctions from traditional sensitivity analysis are made, as well as linkages to dynamic analysis for discovery of generalized value robust alternatives.},

abstract = {Homologous pairing and braiding (supercoiling) have crucial effects on genome organization, maintenance, and evolution. Generally, the pairing and braiding processes are discussed in different contexts, independently of each other. However, analysis of electrostatic interactions between DNA double helices suggests that in some situations these processes may be related. Here we present a theory of DNA braiding that accounts for the elastic energy of DNA double helices as well as for the chiral nature of the discrete helical patterns of DNA charges. This theory shows that DNA braiding may be affected, stabilized, or even driven by chiral electrostatic interactions. For example, electrostatically driven braiding may explain the surprising recent observation of stable pairing of homologous double-stranded DNA in solutions containing only monovalent salt. Electrostatic stabilization of left-handed braids may stand behind the chiral selectivity of type II topoisomerases and positive plasmid supercoiling in hyperthermophilic bacteria and archea.},

abstract = {The growing complexity of modern society is fostering great attention to the issue of the continuity of critical services and related infrastructures. The underlying processes and physical components of a specific service delivery (e.g. electric power or water) reveal many dependencies both technical and non technical. The paper presents an integrated methodology for vulnerability and resilience analysis for underground infrastructures, i.e. a societal risk analysis of the failures of underground services for an urban area. Based on the use of a hybrid approach, the proposed methodology breaks down the area under analysis into sub-areas and assesses the dependencies among sub-areas both in terms of interoperability, damage propagation of critical infrastructures and target zoned-description. The methodology demonstrates clear advantage in terms of resilience analysis, more consistent with the “zoned” nature of failures of the underground infrastructures. A case study, dealing with the interoperability and damage propagation analysis of the underground infrastructures of a Northern Italy town, will be presented for this purpose. A resilience analysis of the “system of systems” (i.e. multiple underground infrastructures) can be performed through the proposed methodology, evaluating the internal characteristics of the system able to mitigate or amplify the impact of local failures and thus the capability to assure service continuity after such failures. Finally a strategy for risk mitigation is proposed in order to maintain the minimum level of service.},

In this setting, the choice of scenario-independent activity start times frequently leads to infeasible schedules or severe losses in revenues. We suggest to determine an optimal target processing time policy for the project activities instead. Such a policy prescribes an activity to be started as early as possible in the realized scenario, but never before its (scenario-independent) target processing time. We formulate the resulting model as a global optimization problem and present a branch-and-bound algorithm for its solution. Extensive numerical results illustrate the suitability of the proposed policy class and the runtime behavior of the algorithm. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

The Zone of Resilience is defined as the desired balance between vulnerabilities and capabilities, where it is proposed that firms will be the most profitable in the long term. We identified seven vulnerability factors composed of 40 specific attributes and 14 capability factors from 71 attributes that facilitate the measurement of resilience.

@article{Mohaghegh-Ahmadabadi2007,
abstract = {This research covers a targeted review of relevant theories and technical domains related to the incorporation of organizational factors into technological systems risk. In the absence of a comprehensive set of principles and modeling guidelines rooted in theory and empirical studies, all models look equally good, or equally poor, with very little basis to discriminate and build confidence. Therefore, this research focused on the possibility of improving the theoretical foundations and principles for the field of Organizational Safety Risk Analysis. Also, a process for adapting a hybrid modeling technique, in order to operationalize the theoretical organizational safety frameworks, is proposed. Candidate ingredients are techniques from Risk Assessment, Human Reliability, Social and Behavioral Science, Business Process Modeling, and Dynamic Modeling. Then, as a realization of aforementioned modeling principles, an organizational safety risk framework, named Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA)1 is developed. The proposed framework considers the theoretical relation between organizational safety culture, organizational safety structure/practices, and organizational safety climate, with specific distinction between safety culture and safety climate. A systematic view of safety culture and safety climate fills an important gap in modeling complex system safety risk, and thus the proposed organizational safety risk theory describing the theoretical relation between two concepts to bridge this gap. In contrast to the current safety causal models which do not adequately consider the multilevel nature of the issue, the proposed multilevel causal model explicitly recognizes the relationships among constructs at multiple levels of analysis. Other contributions of this research are in implementing the proposed organizational safety framework in the aviation domain, particularly the airline maintenance system. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has sponsored this research over the past three years, has recognized the issue of organizational factors as one of the most critical questions in the quest to achieve 80{\%} reduction in aviation accidents. An example of the proposed hybrid modeling environment including an integration of System Dynamics (SD), Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), Event Sequence Diagram (ESD), and Fault Tree (FT), is also applied in order to demonstrate the value of hybrid frameworks. This hybrid technique integrates deterministic and probabilistic modeling perspectives, and provides a flexible risk management tool. 1 Soteroa was the goddess of safety, and of deliverance and preservation from harm in Greek mythology.},

abstract = {This article investigates transitions at the level of societal functions (e.g. transport, communication, housing). Societal functions are fulfilled by socio-technical systems, which consist of a cluster of aligned elements, e.g. artefacts, knowledge, user practices and markets, regulation, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks. To understand how transitions from one socio-technical system to another come about, the article describes a conceptual multi-level perspective. The perspective is illustrated with a historical case study: the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles in the USA (1860-1930). The case study shows that technological substitution approaches to this transition are too simple, because they neglect the electric tram and bicycle, which acted as important stepping stones. The case study also corrects another mistake, namely that the gasoline car won by chance from steam and electric automobiles. It will be shown that particular niches played a crucial role in this competition, as well as the wider socio-technical context. The case study deviates on three points from the multi-level perspective. These deviations are used to conceptualize a particular transition pathway, called 'de-alignment and re-alignment'.},

This work considers multiple assumptions on the system behavior and corresponding alternative plausible modeling hypotheses. To characterize the uncertainty in the correctness of the different hypotheses, the opinions of different experts are treated probabilistically or, in alternative, by the belief and plausibility functions of the Dempster-Shafer theory. A comparison is made with reference to a flow model for the evaluation of the hydraulic head distributions present at a radioactive waste repository site. Three experts are assumed available for the evaluation of the uncertainties associated with the hydrogeological properties of the repository and the groundwater flow mechanisms.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of adaptation of human communities to global changes, especially climate change, in the context of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. It focuses on scholarship that contributes to practical implementation of adaptations at the community scale. In numerous social science fields, adaptations are considered as responses to risks associated with the interaction of environmental hazards and human vulnerability or adaptive capacity. In the climate change field, adaptation analyses have been undertaken for several distinct purposes. Impact assessments assume adaptations to estimate damages to longer term climate scenarios with and without adjustments. Evaluations of specified adaptation options aim to identify preferred measures. Vulnerability indices seek to provide relative vulnerability scores for countries, regions or communities. The main purpose of participatory vulnerability assessments is to identify adaptation strategies that are feasible and practical in communities. The distinctive features of adaptation analyses with this purpose are outlined, and common elements of this approach are described. Practical adaptation initiatives tend to focus on risks that are already problematic, climate is considered together with other environmental and social stresses, and adaptations are mostly integrated or mainstreamed into other resource management, disaster preparedness and sustainable development programs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

VBP is proceeding without high-level evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving health care quality. Rising health care costs, however, make VBP an attractive approach for curtailing costs and emphasizing improved quality, and VBP is likely to become a more prevalent mechanism of reimbursement for providers and facilities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pursuit of sustainable development requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems. Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent "resilience" bytaking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps: identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.},

The goals are to identify optimal strategies for allocating resources among possible defensive investments, and to develop qualitative guidelines that reflect those strategies. The novel feature of the approach is the use of reliability analysis together with game theory and optimization to study optimal management of intentional threats to system reliability. Thus, this work extends and adapts the existing body of game-theoretic work on security to systems with series or parallel structures. The results yield insights into the nature of optimal defensive investments that yield the best tradeoff between investment cost and security. In particular, the results illustrate how the optimal allocation of defensive investments depends on the structure of the system, the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure protection investments, and the adversary's goals and constraints. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For some applications the degradation measurement process destroys or changes the physical/mechanical characteristics of test units. In such applications, only one meaningful measurement can be can be taken on each test unit. This is known as “destructive degradation.” Degradation tests are often accelerated by testing at higher than usual levels of accelerating variables like temperature. This chapter describes an important class of models for accelerated destructive degradation data. We use likelihood-based methods for inference on both the degradation and the induced failure-time distributions.

abstract = {Over the past five years, researchers working on a number of system design projects in the Space Systems, Policy, and Architecture Research Consortium (SSPARC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process of value-focused, broad tradespace exploration for the development of space systems. The broad tradespace framework has provided insights into communicating and quantifying the impact of changing requirements, uncertainty, and system properties such as flexibility and robustness. Additionally, insights have been made in applications to more complex cases, such as analyzing policy effects on system cost and performance, as well as understanding the time-dependent effects of architecture and design choices for spiral development. The tradespace exploration paradigm both broadens the perspective of designers in conceptual design to better understand the “physics” of the proposed solutions relative to one another, and focuses the designer on delivering systems of value to key system stakeholders.

@article{Nurre2012,
abstract = {We consider the problem of restoring services provided by infrastructure systems after an extreme event disrupts them. This research proposes a novel integrated network design and scheduling problem that models these restoration efforts. In this problem, work groups must be allocated to build nodes and arcs into a network in order to maximize the cumulative weighted flow in the network over a horizon. We develop a novel heuristic dispatching rule that selects the next set of tasks to be processed by the work groups. We further propose families of valid inequalities for an integer programming formulation of the problem, one of which specifically links the network design and scheduling decisions. Our methods are tested on realistic data sets representing the infrastructure systems of New Hanover County, North Carolina in the United States and lower Manhattan in New York City. These results indicate that our methods can be used in both real-time restoration activities and long-term scenario planning activities. Our models are also applied to explore the effects on the restoration activities of aligning them with the goals of an emergency manager and to benchmark existing restoration procedures. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bach2013,
abstract = {In recent years, resilience has become a key term in disaster risk management (DRM). Its potential has been mainly discussed with respect to social-ecological systems as well as communities. With respect to Critical Infrastructures (CIs) however, resilience and vulnerability are often used without clear definition and reference to the DRM context. This paper aims to conceptualize vulnerability and resilience for the CI context. Building on socio-ecological approaches, the paper will outline the added value that a more stringent conceptualization of resilience offers for DRM of CIs. After an introduction of CIs and their meaning in the context of DRM (Section 1), the distinct features of the resilience concept and its application in different disciplines are presented (Section 2). Some of the governance challenges associated with the implementation of resilience strategies are presented (Section 3) before conclusions are drawn (Section 4).},

Differentiated transition contexts determine the form and direction of regime change in response to these pressures. The articulation of pressures, and the degree to which responses are coordinated and based on resources available within the regime, define the transition context. Four alternative contexts are described: endogenous renewal; re-orientation of trajectories; emergent transformation and purposive transitions. Agency and power in the governance of regime transformation are analysed. Power to affect change depends on regime membership, the distribution of resources for change and expectations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dolata2009,
abstract = {Following up on recent debates about sectoral systems of innovation and production, the paper introduces a heuristic framework for analyzing and explaining distinct patterns of technology-based sectoral change. The concept is based on two interrelated influencing factors. The first is the sectoral-specific transformative capacity of new technologies themselves, that is, their substantial or incremental impact on socioeconomic and institutional change in a given sectoral system. The second is the sectoral adaptability of socioeconomic structures, institutions, and actors confronted with the opportunities presented by new technologies. The first factor-the sectoral transformative capacity of new technologies-enables us to identify the technology-based pressure to change and adjust the structural, institutional, and organizational architectures of the sectoral system. The second, complementary factor-sectoral adaptability-helps us to discern the distinct social patterns of anticipating and adopting this technology-based pressure. The specific interplay between the two influencing factors creates distinguishable modes of sectoral transformation, ranging from anticipative and smooth adjustments to reactive and crisis-ridden patterns of change. Even processes of radical sectoral change continue over longer periods of mismatch and are characterized by numerous and mostly gradual organizational, structural and institutional transformations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent natural and manmade disasters have had significant regional economic impacts. These effects have been muted, however, by the resilience of individual businesses and of regional markets, which refers to the inherent ability and adaptive responses that enable firms and regions to avoid potential losses. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis is a promising approach to disaster impact analysis because it is able to model the behavioral response to input shortages and changing market conditions. However, without further refinement, CGE models, as well as nearly all other economic models, reflect only "business-as-usual" conditions, when they are based on historical data. This paper advances the CGE analysis of major supply disruptions of critical inputs by: specifying operational definitions of individual business and regional macroeconomic resilience, linking production function parameters to various types of producer adaptations in emergencies, developing algorithms for recalibrating production functions to empirical or simulation data, and decomposing partial and general equilibrium responses. We illustrate some of these contributions in a case study of the sectoral and regional economic impacts of a disruption to the Portland Metropolitan Water System in the aftermath of a major earthquake.},

abstract = {Vulnerability and resilience constitute different but overlapping research themes embraced by sustainability science. As practiced within this science, the two research themes appear to coalesce around one of the foundational pivots of sustainability, the coupled human-environment system. They differ in regard to their attention to two other pivots, environmental services and the tradeoffs of these services with human outcomes. In this essay I briefly review the emergence of sustainability science and the three foundational pivots relevant to vulnerability and resilience. I outline the distinctions and similarities between the two research themes foremost as practiced within sustainability science and especially in regard to the attention given to the three pivots. I conclude with the observation that improvement in the capacity of vulnerability and resilience research to inform sustainability science may hinge on their linkages in addressing tradeoffs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The Goliat field outside the northern coast of Norway will be the first offshore oil development in this region, with planned production start in 2013-2014. Avoiding major accidents at Goliat is critical; not only to reduce the risks to human lives and the environment, but also to gain political acceptance. Providing early warnings of major accidents for Goliat is one of the main objectives of the research project 'Building Safety'. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of early warnings in the form of indicators. In addition, the paper includes an overview of current status of early warnings of accidents in other major hazard industries; the nuclear power industry, the chemical process industry, and aviation. Experiences from these industries, including lessons learned from recent major accidents, have been used as important input to the development of early warning indicators. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It focuses on the development of efficient restoration strategies that aid the supply chain in recovering from a disruption, thereby limiting the impact on its customers. The proposed restoration model takes into account possible disruptions to infrastructures, e.g., transportation and communications, by explicitly formulating their logical relationships with supply chains. A problem solving process is proposed that provides for cooperation between the managers of the infrastructures and the managers of the supply chains disrupted by an extreme event. Both the model and the problem solving process are exercised with a realistic industry problem. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is a matter of adapting demand to technical system capacity: de- creasing demand enables a system to remain in operation and to recover more quickly. Internal system organisation as well as links between technical systems and other regions may also be a factor in the resilience of technical systems. iv. Organisational resilience expresses the capacity to mobilise an area much wider than the one affected.},

But Pigou did recognize that positive transaction cost played a role in creating externality problems even though the profession later failed to do so. The present paper documents this, and it suggests instead that the core disagreement was in Pigou's willingness to rely on an omnicient State to implement policy and Coase's refusal to do so. In a comparison of these two views, Coase's zero transaction cost model plays a more important role than that commonly assigned it.},

This article analyzes various risks and challenges in product development under the concurrent engineering environment. A three-dimensional early warning approach for product development risk management is proposed by integrating graphical evaluation and review technique (GERT) and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). Simulation models are created to solve our proposed concurrent engineering product development risk management model. Solutions lead to identification of key risk controlling points. This article demonstrates the value of our approach to risk analysis as a means to monitor various risks typical in the manufacturing sector. This article has three main contributions. First, we establish a conceptual framework to classify various risks in concurrent engineering (CE) product development (PD). Second, we propose use of existing quantitative approaches for PD risk analysis purposes: GERT, FMEA, and product database management (PDM). Based on quantitative tools, we create our approach for risk management of CE PD and discuss solutions of the models. Third, we demonstrate the value of applying our approach using data from a typical Chinese motor company.},

This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods, thus, providing a basis for guiding the engineer to the most appropriate techniques. It also addresses performance aspects and test scenarios for direct robust optimization techniques.},

abstract = {The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Ecosystem restoration is fast becoming the third major strategy of the modern environmental era, which began in the 1960s by seeking to mitigate the effects of conventional, exploitation-dominated resource management and then, in the 1970s, turned to pollution prevention and preservation of wildlife, recreational opportunities, and other multiple uses.1 The goals of recent restoration plans are anything but simple. Those who seek to restore any ecosystem must deal with two separate problems. The first is a social problem, which is an attempt to define goals and objectives, or to develop a collective sense of what society wants. Closely tied to that articulation of "what we want" is the complex array of pre-existing and emerging social structures- laws, policies, and institutions that frame the options for achieving a vision of restoration. The second problem is scientific, in which experts attempt to lay out a range of ecological trajectories, structures (such as biological diversity), and functions that define possible restoration outcomes. Almost invariably, the first problem (what do we want?) overshadows the second problem (what can we get?) in implementation. As a result, both goals become difficult if not impossible to attain and, over time, both ecological and social restoration aspirations fail. A key challenge for designers and managers of restoration plans is to recognize the interplay between, and constraints imposed by, both the sociopolitical and biophysical worlds. By weaving ecological principles and legal analysis together, we hope to shed light on the successes and failures of two landmark restoration projects: the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River and the Florida Everglades. These projects share common goals-to restore degraded habitat and to maintain water supplies. They also share a common problem-making meaningful progress towards restoration goals. In the Grand Canyon, modest successes have been achieved through an adaptive management program that attempts to blend the social and ecological objectives. In the Everglades, however, the restoration approach has separated the ecological from the social, legal, and political domains, and as a result has accomplished very little.2 The successes and failures of these experiments in ecosystem restoration are a result of many factors. In this Article, we focus on three elemental ingredients. The first is the emerging system property of resilience, a concept that describes a more complex model of change and restoration than typical resource management goals related to maximizing social uses and achieving optimum yields of resource outputs. Resilience is a characteristic of both social and ecological systems. Resilience theory suggests that complex systems can exist in fundamentally different regimes, and resilience is the property that mediates transitions among those regimes. Hence resilience must be overcome when undertaking objectives that involve regime changes, such as an ecological restoration or a social transformation. In fact, a comparative analysis of the Grand Canyon and Everglades projects reveals that resilience may not always be a good thing, particularly when it exhibits itself as entrenched stakeholder interests or institutions that do not embrace change. A second significant factor in achieving restoration goals is legislation and other legal requirements, which can either enable or constrain ecosystem restoration. The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 19923 and the Everglades restoration provisions of the Water Resources Development Act of 20004 specifically authorize restoration. At the same time, existing, generally applicable legislation, such as the Clean Water Act5 and the Endangered Species Act,6 remains in play and adds to the complexities of ecosystem restoration. The third factor involves the administration of legislation through agencies' initiatives and public participation, particularly stakeholder involvement. Whether combative, collaborative, or somewhere in between, the participants' commitment to experimentation and adaptation in the implementation of a restoration plan has a profound influence on the speed and trajectory of restoration. The remainder of this Article is structured as follows. Part II discusses the concept of resilience and how it underpins notions of restoration and sustainability. National legislative goals and requirements related to these concepts are then described. Next, Part III takes a close look at the physical characteristics and specific legislative directives for the Everglades and the Grand Canyon. Part IV sets forth several "lessons learned" from these two restoration projects. Finally, Part V concludes with broader observations about restoration and resilience. Success is not possible, and failure may be inevitable, unless the science of ecology, environmental law, and public administration are calibrated to foster experimentation, learning, and adaptation in management strategies.},

The IIM is based on Leontief’s input-output model, which characterizes interdependencies among sectors in the economy and analyzes initial disruptions to a set of sectors and the resulting ripple effects. An advantage of building on Leontief’s model is that it is supported by publications of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Independent computer runs of the IIM can represent the entire nation or sectors within particular U.S. regions. A dynamic extension of the IIM analyzes different temporal frames of recovery and characterizes the required sector adjustments for achieving new production levels. The IIM can systemically prioritize and manage the sectors deemed to be economically critical and also identify those sectors whose continued operability is critical during recovery. A companion paper demonstrates applying the IIM to attacks on electric power and telecommunications.},

abstract = {Economic recovery refers to the process by which businesses and local economies return to conditions of stability following a disaster. Its importance and complexity are being increasingly recognized in disaster risk reduction research and practice. This paper provides an overview of current research on economic recovery and suggests a research agenda to address key gaps in knowledge. Empirical studies have provided a number of robust findings on the disaster recovery of businesses and local economies, with particular insights into short- and long-term recovery patterns, influential factors in recovery, and disparities in recovery across types of businesses and economies. Modeling studies have undertaken formal analyses of economic impacts of disasters in which recovery is usually addressed through the incorporation of resilience actions and investments in repair and reconstruction. Core variables for assessing and understanding economic recovery are identified from the literature, and approaches for measuring or estimating them are discussed. The paper concludes with important gaps in the development of a robust theory of economic recovery. Systematic data collection is needed to establish patterns and variations on how well and how quickly local economies recover from disasters. Research is urgently needed on the effectiveness of resilience approaches, decisions, and policies for recovery at both the business and local economy levels. Detailed, testable theoretical frameworks will be important for advancing understanding and developing sound recovery plans and policies. It will be especially important to consider the relationship between economic recovery and recovery of the built environment and sociopolitical fabric of communities in developing a comprehensive theory of disaster recovery.},

The continued prosperity and national security of the US depends on our ability to understand the vulnerabilities of and analyze the performance of both the individual infrastructures and the entire interconnected system of infrastructures. Only then can we respond to potential disruptions in a timely and effective manner. Collaborative efforts among Sandia, other government agencies, private industry, and academia have resulted in realistic models formany of the individual component infrastructures. In this paper,we propose an innovative modeling and analysis framework to study the entire system of physical and economic infrastructures. That framework uses the existing individual models together with system dynamics, functional models, and nonlinear optimization algorithms.We describe this framework and demonstrate its potential use to analyze, and propose a response for, a hypothetical disruption.},

@article{Hofoss2008,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: Patient safety improvement is a healthcare priority worldwide. Pioneer research reports include the 1984 Harvard Medical Practice Study, and the 1999 report "To err is human''. Patient safety research is expanding rapidly. Among the Scandinavian countries, Denmark is the patient safety improvement leader, and Norway is the laggard, having only recently institutionalized safety research and then having started with industrial safety research, and only recently having expanded into patient safety research.

AIMS: To produce a roadmap for patient safety research, indicating three main roadforks. Patient safety research can be conducted along a number of lines. To identify patient safety problems and come up with ideas for patient safety improvement one can investigate 1) particular cases of adverse events, 2) the design of healthcare delivery systems, or 3) the culture of the care-giving institutions. The study of safety culture can be subdivided into the study of organization culture in general (and in particular of leadership culture) and the study of patient safety culture. The article provides a number of references to existing instruments of patient safety research.

METHODS: Qualitative interpretation of the referenced literature.

RESULTS: Scrutinizing adverse events for errors is health care's traditional way of improving patient safety. The idea of rethinking the design of care delivery systems has been accompanied by claims of modernity. The study of patient safety culture is the most recent approach. The three approaches are discussed in separate sub-chapters.

CONCLUSIONS: Although chronology suggests a developmental trend, the three approaches should not necessarily be seen as steps up the ladder of evolution. Each approach does have its merits.},

abstract = {Many real world optimization problems involve uncertainties. A solution for such a problem is expected to be robust to these uncertainties. Commonly, robustness is attained by choosing the solution’s parameters such that the solution’s performance is less influenced by negative effects of the uncertain parameters’ variations. This robustness may be viewed as a passive robustness, because once the solution’s parameters are chosen, the robustness is inherent in the solution and no further action, to suppress the effect of uncertainties, is expected. However, it is acknowledged that enhanced robustness comes on the expense of peak performances. In this study, Active Robust Optimization is presented as a new robust optimization approach. It considers products that are able to adapt to environmental changes. The enhanced robustness of these solutions is attained by adaptation, which reduces the loss in performance due to environmental changes. A new optimization problem named Active Robust Optimization Problem is formulated. The problem amalgamates robust optimization with dynamic optimization in order to evaluate the performance of a candidate solution, while considering possible environmental conditions. Adaptation’s influence on the solution’s performance and cost is considered as well. Hence, the problem is formulated as a multiobjective problem that simultaneously aims at low costs and high performance. Since these goals are commonly in conflict: the solution is a set of optimal adaptive solutions. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed in order to evolve this set. An example of optimizing an adaptive optical table is provided. It is shown that an adaptive product, which is an outcome of the suggested approach, may be superior to an equivalent product that is not adaptive.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to establish a holistic framework for defining and measuring disaster resilience for a community at various scales. Seven dimensions of community resilience have been identified and are represented by the acronym PEOPLES: Population and Demographics, Environmental/ Ecosystem, Organized Governmental Services, Physical Infrastructure, Lifestyle and Community Competence, Economic Development, and Social-Cultural Capital. The proposed PEOPLES Resilience Framework provides the basis for development of quantitative and qualitative models that measure continuously the resilience of communities against extreme events or disasters in any or a combination of the above-mentioned dimensions. Over the longer term, this framework will enable the development of geospatial and temporal decision- support software tools that help planners and other key decision makers and stakeholders to assess and enhance the resilience of their communities.},

MBSE focuses the system engineering process on system modeling. Thus, requirements derivation, system design, integration, verification, and validation activities all center around the model of the system. System models can be built in many ways. This paper presents an approach using DoDAF. Visual accessibility of the DoDAF views facilitates full participation by all system stakeholders, including the customers, developers, and implementers, and enables the necessary dialogue. The approach promotes communications among the members of the development team and speeds up the iterations of the systems engineering process. The paper illustrates the utility of the DoDAF artifacts by means of a simplified but comprehensive, easy to follow, illustrative example.},

@phdthesis{Nejad-Hosseinian2007,
abstract = {Dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) is a systematic and comprehensive methodology that has been used and refined over the past two decades to evaluate the risks associated with complex systems such as nuclear power plants, space missions, chemical plants, and military systems. A critical step in DPRA is generating risk scenarios which are used to enumerate and assess the probability of different outcomes. The classical approach to generating risk scenarios is not, however, sufficient to deal with the complexity of the above-mentioned systems. The primary contribution of this dissertation is in offering a new method for capturing different types of engineering knowledge and using them to automatically generate risk scenarios, presented in the form of generalized event sequence diagrams, for dynamic systems. This new method, as well as several important applications, is described in detail. The most important application is within a new framework for DPRA in which the risk simulation environment is guided to explore more interesting scenarios such as low-probability/high-consequence scenarios. Another application considered is the use of the method to enhance the process of risk-based design.},

Three types of change processes are identified: reproduction, transformation and transition. 'Reproduction' refers to incremental change along existing trajectories. 'Transformation' refers to a change in the direction of trajectories, related to a change in rules that guide innovative action. 'Transition' refers to a discontinuous shift to a new trajectory and system. Using the multi-level perspective, the underlying mechanisms of these change processes are identified. The transformation and transition processes are empirically illustrated by two contrasting case studies: the hygienic transition from cesspools to integrated sewer systems (1870-1930) and the transformation in waste management (1960-2000) in the Netherlands. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

After surveying existing approaches for scenario planning, a methodology for specifying and analyzing large numbers of alternative system time lines is presented. A satellite radar case study is used to motivate and illustrate the value of this approach. Benefits of the methodology include: (1) broader and more rigorous consideration of alternative future needs, contexts, and time lines, (2) identification of gaps in traditionally-derived scenario sets, (3) identification of passively value-robust system alternatives, and (4) providing a basis for evaluating system evolution strategies that enable sustainment of value delivery across potential time lines.},

First, we discuss several systematic approaches for identifying possible extreme events. We then discuss some issues related to risk assessment of extreme events, including what type of output is needed (e.g., a single probability vs. a probability distribution), and alternatives to the probabilistic approach. Next, we present a number of probabilistic methods. These include : guidelines for eliciting informative probability distributions from experts; maximum entropy distributions; extreme value theory; other approaches for constructing prior distributions (such as reference or noninformative priors); the use of modeling and decomposition to estimate the probability (or distribution) of interest; and bounding methods. Finally, we briefly discuss several approaches for managing the risk of extreme events, and conclude with recommendations and directions for future research.},

@article{Pflanz2012,
abstract = {From a national defense, as well as a civilian infrastructure perspective, a need exists to design and develop systems resilient to disruption. Disruptions are often difficult to predict or may be potentially unavoidable. Systems able to survive and recover from disruption are referred to as resilient. In the case of mission critical systems, such as command and control systems, resilience is a necessary characteristic and must be considered early in the development cycle. This paper describes a quantitative approach to evaluating the expected resilience of a command and control system. The approach uses a Petri Net based executable model of the system architecture. The rigorous graph-theoretic and executable properties of Petri Nets are leveraged to support static and dynamic measures of the attributes of resilience. These measures are then combined into a holistic evaluation of resilience for the command and control system under study. The evaluation results can then be used to support selection among alternative candidate architectures and to identify areas for improvement in the selected architecture. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Whether it be decisions about the design of products, manufacturing processes, public works, or developing technological solutions to environmental, social and global problems, risk taking seems inherent to the profession. Despite this, little attention has been paid to the topic and specifically to how our understanding of engineering as a distinctive profession might affect how we should make decisions under risk. This paper seeks to remedy this, firstly by offering a nuanced account of risk and then by considering how specific claims about our understanding of engineering as a social profession, with corresponding social values and obligations, should inform how we make decisions about risk in this context.},

abstract = {We describe joint defender, a new two-sided optimization model for planning the pre-positioning of defensive missile interceptors to counter an attack threat. In our basic model, a defender pre-positions ballistic missile defense platforms to minimize the worst-case damage an attacker can achieve; we assume that the attacker will be aware of defensive pre-positioning decisions, and that both sides have complete information as to target values, attacking-missile launch sites, weapon system capabilities, etc. Other model variants investigate the value of secrecy by restricting the attacker's and/or defender's access to information. For a realistic scenario, we can evaluate a completely transparent exchange in a few minutes on a laptop computer, and can plan near-optimal secret defenses in seconds. Joint defender's mathematical foundation and its computational efficiency complement current missile-defense planning tools that use heuristics or supercomputing. The model can also provide unique insight into the value of secrecy and deception to either side. We demonstrate with two hypothetical North Korean scenarios.},

Quantification of resilience is first approached from the broader societal context, from which the engineering subproblem is formulated, recognizing that, to operate, hospitals depend intricately on the performance of their physical infrastructure ?from the integrity of structural systems and nonstructural systems, lifelines, components, and equipment?. Quantification relates the probability of exceeding floor accelerations and interstory drifts within a specified limit space, for the structural and nonstructural performance. Linear and nonlinear structural responses are considered, as well as the impact of retrofit or repair. Impact on time to recovery is considered in all cases. The proposed framework makes it possible to relate probability functions, fragilities, and resilience in a single integrated approach, and to further develop general tools to quantify resilience for sociopolitical-engineering decisions.},

@article{Loft2010,
abstract = {Theories and methods from the prospective memory literature were used to anticipate how individuals would maintain and retrieve intentions in a continuous monitoring dynamic display task. Participants accepted aircraft into sectors and detected aircraft conflicts during an air traffic control simulation. They were sometimes required to substitute new actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft traveling at certain speeds or altitudes, or with certain call signs. In Experiment 1, prospective memory error increased with intent to deviate from strong compared to weak routine, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to speed intentions. In addition, errors increased when intentions were general compared to specific. Participants also missed more conflicts when deviating from strong compared to weak routine. In Experiment 2, errors increased for intentions nonfocal to ongoing tasks compared to focal, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to call sign intentions. Participants were slower to accept aircraft when holding nonfocal compared to focal intentions, and slower to accept aircraft and detect conflicts when holding focal intentions compared to no intentions. These findings are consistent with theories that assume that individuals allocate limited-capacity attentional resources to prospective memory tasks. Increased error for altitude intentions, together with the effect of routine strength, suggest a vulnerability to error with increased strength of association between prospective memory cues and competing ongoing tasks. Ongoing tasks that focus attention on cues may sometimes impair, rather than benefit, intention retrieval.},

abstract = {In this article, we link an engineering concept, reliability, to a financial and managerial concept, net present value, by exploring the impact of a system's reliability on its revenue generation capability. The framework here developed for non-repairable systems quantitatively captures the value of reliability from a financial standpoint. We show that traditional present value calculations of engineering systems do not account for system reliability, thus over-estimate a system's worth and can therefore lead to flawed investment decisions. It is therefore important to involve reliability engineers upfront before investment decisions are made in technical systems. In addition, the analyses here developed help designers identify the optimal level of reliability that maximizes a system's net present value - the financial value reliability provides to the system minus the cost to achieve this level of reliability. Although we recognize that there are numerous considerations driving the specification of an engineering system's reliability, we contend that the financial analysis of reliability here developed should be made available to decision-makers to support in part, or at least be factored into, the system reliability specification. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an alternative approach for valuing Real Options based on the certainty-equivalent version of the net present value formula, which eliminates the need to identify market-priced twin securities. In addition, our approach can be extended to the case of multinomial trees, a useful tool for modeling uncertainty in projects. We introduce within decision tree analysis (DTA) a method to derive the different discount rates that prevail at different chance nodes. We illustrate the valuation method with an application presented in "A Scenario Approach to Capacity Planning" [Eppen, G.D., Martin, R.K., Schrage, L.E., 1989. A scenario approach to capacity planning. Operations Research, 37 (4)], in which the authors state that for the capacity configuration investment decision studied at General Motors, "... there is no scientific way to determine the appropriate discount rate based on estimated demand." Our method allows deriving the scientifically correct discount rates. A major result of the analysis is that the discount rates are endogenously derived from the project structure and its behavior in light of prevailing market conditions, instead of being exogenously imposed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The concept of emerging risk has gained increasing attention in recent years. The term has an intuitive appeal and meaning but a consistent and agreed definition is missing. We perform an in-depth analysis of this concept, in particular its relation to black swan type of events, and show that these can be considered meaningful and complementary concepts by relating emerging risk to known unknowns and black swans to unknown knowns, unknown unknowns and a subset of known knowns. The former is consistent with saying that we face emerging risk related to an activity when the background knowledge is weak but contains indications/justified beliefs that a new type of event (new in the context of that activity) could occur in the future and potentially have severe consequences to something humans value. The weak background knowledge among other things results in difficulty specifying consequences and possibly also in fully specifying the event itself; i.e. in difficulty specifying scenarios. Here knowledge becomes the key concept for both emerging risk and black swan type of events, allowing for taking into consideration time dynamics since knowledge develops over time.

Typically plant shutdown is required. In situations where the risk associated with the action, i.e. the risk of plant shutdown given a failure of the safety system, may be substantial, a strategy is needed to control the plant risk. In this study the changing operation modes are evaluated quantitatively and dynamically using the tool of system dynamics. System dynamics has been developed to analyze the dynamic reliability of a complicated system. System dynamics using the Vensim software have been applied to LCOs assessment for an example system, the auxiliary feed water system of a reference nuclear power plant. Analysis results of both full power operation and shutdown operation have been compared for a measure of core damage frequency. The increase in core damage frequency is used as a measure in this study. A time dependent framework developed in this study has been shown to be very flexible in that it can be applied to assess LCOs quantitatively under any operational context of the Technical Specifications in Final Safety Analysis Report of the reference plant.},

abstract = {The premise of this article is that risk to a system, as well as its vulnerability and resilience, can be understood, defined, and quantified most effectively through a systems-based philosophical and methodological approach, and by recognizing the central role of the system states in this process. A universally agreed-upon definition of risk has been difficult to develop; one reason is that the concept is multidimensional and nuanced. It requires an understanding that risk to a system is inherently and fundamentally a function of the initiating event, the states of the system and of its environment, and the time frame. In defining risk, this article posits that: (a) the performance capabilities of a system are a function of its state vector; (b) a system's vulnerability and resilience vectors are each a function of the input (e.g., initiating event), its time of occurrence, and the states of the system; (c) the consequences are a function of the specificity and time of the event, the vector of the states, the vulnerability, and the resilience of the system; (d) the states of a system are time-dependent and commonly fraught with variability uncertainties and knowledge uncertainties; and (e) risk is a measure of the probability and severity of consequences. The above implies that modeling must evaluate consequences for each risk scenario as functions of the threat (initiating event), the vulnerability and resilience of the system, and the time of the event. This fundamentally complex modeling and analysis process cannot be performed correctly and effectively without relying on the states of the system being studied.},

It cover a wide variety of nanotubular materials excluding carbon nanotubes, ranging from metal oxides, sulfides and nitrides such as titanium oxide, tungsten sulfide, and boron nitride, as well as platinum and other noble-metals to unique nanotubes consisting of water, graphen or fulleren. Based on their structural and compositional characteristics, these nanotubular materials are of importance for their potential applications in electronic devices, photocatalysts, dye-sensitized solar cells, nanothermometer, electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, sensors, and reinforcing fillers for plastics, among others. Such materials are also having a great impact on future developments, including renewable energy sources as well as highly efficient energy-conversion and energy-saving technologies. This book will be of particular interest to graduate students in chemistry and physics as well as experts in the fields of nanotechnology, material science and inorganic and solid-state chemistry.},

@article{Landrigan2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although sleep deprivation has been shown to impair neurobehavioral performance, few studies have measured its effects on medical errors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized study comparing the rates of serious medical errors made by interns while they were working according to a traditional schedule with extended (24 hours or more) work shifts every other shift (an "every third night" call schedule) and while they were working according to an intervention schedule that eliminated extended work shifts and reduced the number of hours worked per week. Incidents were identified by means of a multidisciplinary, four-pronged approach that included direct, continuous observation. Two physicians who were unaware of the interns' schedule assignments independently rated each incident. RESULTS: During a total of 2203 patient-days involving 634 admissions, interns made 35.9 percent more serious medical errors during the traditional schedule than during the intervention schedule (136.0 vs. 100.1 per 1000 patient-days, P<0.001), including 56.6 percent more nonintercepted serious errors (P<0.001). The total rate of serious errors on the critical care units was 22.0 percent higher during the traditional schedule than during the intervention schedule (193.2 vs. 158.4 per 1000 patient-days, P<0.001). Interns made 20.8 percent more serious medication errors during the traditional schedule than during the intervention schedule (99.7 vs. 82.5 per 1000 patient-days, P=0.03). Interns also made 5.6 times as many serious diagnostic errors during the traditional schedule as during the intervention schedule (18.6 vs. 3.3 per 1000 patient-days, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Interns made substantially more serious medical errors when they worked frequent shifts of 24 hours or more than when they worked shorter shifts. Eliminating extended work shifts and reducing the number of hours interns work per week can reduce serious medical errors in the intensive care unit.},

Maintaining or recovering the normality, when the system is under some stress (instability) is a function of Resilience. To cope with prevention, forecast, recovery and with memory of experiences from learned lessons requires some features from the companies. This paper purposes a structure that enables the Total Resilience of a system production that defines the assignments for Workers, Designers and Management Team, according to its features and possibilities. During one year and a half developing studies on ergonomics area of a Brazilian Oil Refinery, several situations were observed and studied using Work Ergonomic Analysis. These situations show actions and strategies that workers use to maintain the system stability. Furthermore, they revealed the importance that these actions are stored in a database of learned lessons from the Company. The research resulted in a broad scheme. It places each of these groups in the process of Total Resilience. It also shows the human like a center of actions that ensure the continuity of the system, main element at Resilience (Anthropocentric View).},

The distributions of many physical, natural, and social events (earthquake size, species abundance, income and wealth, as well as file, city, and firm sizes) display this structure. We present a test for the occurrence of power-law tails in statistical distributions based on maximum entropy. This methodology allows one to identify the true data-generating processes even in the case when it is neither lognormal nor Pareto. The maximum entropy approach is then compared with other widely used methods and applied to different levels of aggregation of complex systems. Our results provide support for the theory that distributions with lognormal body and Pareto tail can be generated as mixtures of lognormally distributed units.},

abstract = {Simple risk formulas, such as risk = probability × impact, or risk = exposure × probability × consequence, or risk = threat × vulnerability × consequence, are built into many commercial risk management software products deployed in public and private organizations. These formulas, which we call risk indices, together with risk matrices, "heat maps," and other displays based on them, are widely used in applications such as enterprise risk management (ERM), terrorism risk analysis, and occupational safety. But, how well do they serve to guide allocation of limited risk management resources? This article evaluates and compares different risk indices under simplifying conditions favorable to their use (statistically independent, uniformly distributed values of their components; and noninteracting risk-reduction opportunities). Compared to an optimal (nonindex) approach, simple indices produce inferior resource allocations that for a given cost may reduce risk by as little as 60{\%} of what the optimal decisions would provide, at least in our simple simulations. This article suggests a better risk reduction per unit cost index that achieves 98-100{\%} of the maximum possible risk reduction on these problems for all budget levels except the smallest, which allow very few risks to be addressed. Substantial gains in risk reduction achieved for resources spent can be obtained on our test problems by using this improved index instead of simpler ones that focus only on relative sizes of risk (or of components of risk) in informing risk management priorities and allocating limited risk management resources. This work suggests the need for risk management tools to explicitly consider costs in prioritization activities, particularly in situations where budget restrictions make careful allocation of resources essential for achieving close-to-maximum risk-reduction benefits.},

abstract = {This paper presents operational metrics to determine a passenger transportation system's resilience to terrorism. The metrics range from those specific to the number of trips to more holistic measures that include the contribution of these trips directly and indirectly to economic activity. These metrics can aid decision-makers in rendering more informed judgments about resource allocation and how to design a portfolio of security and recovery strategies. The paper also provides a framework for evaluating transportation risk, including the important role of perceptions in potentially amplifying these risks. It provides a range of strategies to promote resilience as well. Resilience of a transportation system is then quantified using the real-world case of the 2005 London subway and bus bombings. In terms of ordinary resilience, we find that 77.4 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were offset by increases in substitute modes for the 4 months following the attacks. We also estimate that 76.9 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were the result of a "fear factor," as opposed to capacity reductions. The paper concludes with a set of proposed prospective resilience measures to evaluate the potential resilience of a transportation system. These metrics are based on the vulnerability, flexibility, and resource availability to cope with a terrorist attack or natural disaster. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In particular, several experimental campaigns have shown a decrease of the material strength under static or fatigue loading with increasing structural size, and some theoretical arguments have been proposed to interpret such a phenomenon. As far as fatigue crack growth is concerned, limited information on size effect is available in the literature. In the present paper, by exploiting some concepts of fractal geometry, new definitions of fracture energy and stress intensity factor based on physical dimensions different from the classical ones are discussed. Then, a size-dependent crack growth law (expressing crack growth rate against stress intensity factor range) is proposed. Finally, such a law is herein used to interpret relevant experimental data related to concrete. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Extreme and catastrophic events pose challenges for normative models of risk management decision making. They invite development of new methods and principles to complement existing normative decision and risk analysis. Because such events are rare, it is difficult to learn about them from experience. They can prompt both too little concern before the fact, and too much after. Emotionally charged and vivid outcomes promote probability neglect and distort risk perceptions. Aversion to acting on uncertain probabilities saps precautionary action; moral hazard distorts incentives to take care; imperfect learning and social adaptation (e.g., herd-following, group-think) complicate forecasting and coordination of individual behaviors and undermine prediction, preparation, and insurance of catastrophic events. Such difficulties raise substantial challenges for normative decision theories prescribing how catastrophe risks should be managed. This article summarizes challenges for catastrophic hazards with uncertain or unpredictable frequencies and severities, hard-to-envision and incompletely described decision alternatives and consequences, and individual responses that influence each other. Conceptual models and examples clarify where and why new methods are needed to complement traditional normative decision theories for individuals and groups. For example, prospective and retrospective preferences for risk management alternatives may conflict; procedures for combining individual beliefs or preferences can produce collective decisions that no one favors; and individual choices or behaviors in preparing for possible disasters may have no equilibrium. Recent ideas for building "disaster-resilient" communities can complement traditional normative decision theories, helping to meet the practical need for better ways to manage risks of extreme and catastrophic events.},

abstract = { Product sustainment means keeping an existing system operational and maintaining the ability to continue to manufacture and field versions of the system that satisfy the original requirements. Sustainment also includes manufacturing and fielding revised versions of the system that satisfy evolving requirements, which often requires the replacement of technologies used to construct the original system with newer technologies. Technology insertion involves determining which technologies to replace during a design refresh, i.e., deciding the design refresh content, and deciding when that design refresh should take place. Technology replacement decisions are driven by a broad range of issues including performance, reliability, environmental impact, cost, and logistics, and when, or if other design refreshes will take place. Traditional "value" metrics go part of the way toward providing a coupled view of performance, reliability and cost, but are generally ignorant of how product sustainment may be impacted. A metric that measures both the value of the technology refreshment and insertion, and its ability to support both the system's current and future affordability and capability needs including hardware, software, information and intellectual property is required. This paper discusses a concept called viability. Viability is a measure of the producibility, supportability, and evolvability of a system and can serve as a metric for assessing technology insertion opportunities.},

abstract = {In virtually every decision he makes, the executive today considers some kind of forecast. Sound predictions of demands and trends are no longer luxury items, but a necessity, if the manager is to cope with seasonality, sudden changes in demand levels, pricecutting maneuvers of the competition, strikes, and large swings of the economy. Forecasting can help him deal with these troubles; but it can help him more, the more he knows about the general principles of forecasting, what it can and cannot do for him currently, and which techniques are suited to his needs of the moment. Here the authors try to explain the potential of forecasting to the manager, focusing special attention on sales forecasting for products of Corning Glass Works as these have matured through the product life cycle. The authors also include a rundown of the whole range of forecasting techniques.

The approach is based on a detailed understanding of the system logic represented using fault-trees, reliability block diagrams or another similar representation. Structure functions of the relevant sensors in terms of component states are used in conjunction with the probability of all possible system states to generate the likelihood function of overlapping evidence.

To that end, the article discusses seven social science ontologies (rational choice, evolution theory, structuralism, interpretivism, functionalism, conflict and power struggle, relationism), their assumptions on agency and causal mechanisms, and their views on socio-technical transitions and environmental sustainability. The second goal is to position the multi-level perspective on transitions with regard to these ontologies and to identify directions for theoretical extensions. The MLP is characterized not as a grand or unifying theory, but as a middle range theory that makes crossovers to some ontologies and not to others. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As infrastructure systems are highly interconnected, it is crucial to analyze their resilience with the consideration of their interdependencies. This paper adapts an existing resilience assessment framework for single systems to interdependent systems and mainly focuses on modeling and resilience contribution analysis of multi-systems’ joint restoration processes, which are seldom addressed in the literature. Taking interdependent power and gas systems in Houston, Texas, USA under hurricane hazards as an illustrative exmaple, five types of joint restoration stategies are proposed, including random restoration strategy RS1, independent restoration strategy RS2, power first and gas second restoration strategy RS3, gas aimed restoration strategy RS4, and power and gas compromised restoration strategy RS5. Results show that under limited restoration resources, RS1 produces the least resilience for both systems, RS2 and RS3 both generates the largest power system resilience while RS4 is the best for the gas system; and if quantifying the total resilience as the evenly weighted sum of two systems’ individual resilience, RS5 produces the largest total resilience. The proposed method can help decision makers search optimum joint restoration strategy, which can significantly enhance both systems’ resilience.},

abstract = {Many technologies have life cycles that are shorter than the life cycle of the product or system they are in. Life cycle mismatches caused by the obsolescence of technology can result in large life cycle costs for long field life systems, such as aircraft, ships, communications infrastructure, power plant and grid management, and military systems. This paper addresses Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materials Shortages (DMSMS) obsolescence, which is defined as the loss of the ability to procure a technology or part from its original manufacturer. Forecasting when technologies and specific parts will become unavailable (non-procurable) is a key enabler for pro-active DMSMS management and strategic life cycle planning for long field life systems. This paper presents a methodology for generating algorithms that can be used to predict the obsolescence dates for electronic parts that do not have clear evolutionary parametric drivers.

abstract = {Complex engineering systems are frequently exposed to large amounts of uncertainty, as many exogenous, uncontrollable conditions change over time and can affect the performance and value delivery of a system. Engineering practice has begun to address that need, with recent methods frequently targeting such techniques as uncertainty quantification or robust engineering as key goals. While passive robustness is beneficial for these long-lived systems, designing for passive robustness frequently results in sub-optimal point designs, as optimization is forgone in favor of safety. Changeability offers an alternative means for supporting value throughout a system's lifecycle by allowing the system to change in response to, or in anticipation of, the resolution of uncertainty, potentially enabling the system to perform at- or near-optimally in a wide range of contexts. The state of the practice for valuing changeability in engineering systems relies mostly on options theory, which is associated with a number of assumptions that are frequently inappropriate when applied to change options embedded in systems. This has played a part in limiting the inclusion of changeability in fielded systems, as the standard techniques for calculating the benefits of change are often inapplicable and thus are less trusted than valuations of passive robustness. Without the ability to properly and believably value changeability, system designers will continue to look elsewhere for protection against uncertainty. A more generally applicable method for valuing changeability would greatly enhance the understanding and appeal of changeability early in the design process, and allow for the justification of its associated costs. This research has resulted in a new five-step approach, called the Valuation Approach for Strategic Changeability (VASC). VASC was designed to capture the multi-dimensional value of changeability while limiting the number of necessary assumptions by building off of previous research on Epoch-Era Analysis. A suite of new metrics (including Effective Fuzzy Pareto Trace, Fuzzy Pareto Number, and Fuzzy Pareto Shift), capturing different types of valuable changeability information, are included in the approach, which is capable of delivering insight both with and without the computational burden of simulation. The application of VASC to three space system case studies demonstrates the large range of insight about the usage and value of changeability able to be extracted with the approach. Discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of VASC is included, particularly in comparison with Real Options Analysis, and a number of promising avenues for future improvements and extensions to VASC},

abstract = {Recent natural and man-made catastrophes, such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant, flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Haiti earthquake, and the mortgage derivatives crisis, have renewed interest in the concept of resilience, especially as it relates to complex systems vulnerable to multiple or cascading failures. Although the meaning of resilience is contested in different contexts, in general resilience is understood to mean the capacity to adapt to changing conditions without catastrophic loss of form or function. In the context of engineering systems, this has sometimes been interpreted as the probability that system conditions might exceed an irrevocable tipping point. However, we argue that this approach improperly conflates resilience and risk perspectives by expressing resilience exclusively in risk terms. In contrast, we describe resilience as an emergent property of what an engineering system does, rather than a static property the system has. Therefore, resilience cannot be measured at the systems scale solely from examination of component parts. Instead, resilience is better understood as the outcome of a recursive process that includes: sensing, anticipation, learning, and adaptation. In this approach, resilience analysis can be understood as differentiable from, but complementary to, risk analysis, with important implications for the adaptive management of complex, coupled engineering systems. Management of the 2011 flooding in the Mississippi River Basin is discussed as an example of the successes and challenges of resilience-based management of complex natural systems that have been extensively altered by engineered structures.},

abstract = {Few policies for risk management have created more controversy than the precautionary principle. A main problem is the extreme number of different definitions and interpretations. Almost all definitions of the precautionary principle identify "scientific uncertainties" as the trigger or criterion for its invocation; however, the meaning of this concept is not clear. For applying the precautionary principle it is not sufficient that the threats or hazards are uncertain. A stronger requirement is needed. This article provides an in-depth analysis of this issue. We question how the scientific uncertainties are linked to the interpretation of the probability concept, expected values, the results from probabilistic risk assessments, the common distinction between aleatory uncertainties and epistemic uncertainties, and the problem of establishing an accurate prediction model (cause-effect relationship). A new classification structure is suggested to define what scientific uncertainties mean.},

abstract = {The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) allocates federal funding to maritime critical infrastructure and key resources (MCIKR) to reduce terrorist attack risk. The PSGP currently emphasizes protecting against attacks, before they happen. However, for the last several years the trend in critical infrastructure risk analysis has been resilience. Resilience often includes examining how a system can restore after a disruption, as opposed to only examining how to prevent disruptions. Accordingly, PSGP policy has evolved to emphasize resilience but with no clear guidance on how to implement a resilience- based approach. This paper therefore discusses considerations to help PSGP stakeholders. First it explains why MCIKR should be modeled as components of supply chains. It then explains why the current mathematical theory underpinning the PSGP is insufficient for a resilience-based, network-focused PSGP. This paper then explores risk-based and network interdiction theories and modeling options that could be leveraged to support allocation of PSGP grants in order to influence supply chain resilience. It proposes a conceptual solution that leverages principles from both approaches, and offers definitions of quantifiable resilience. This proposed solution allows the quantification of deterrence effects of resilience-based grant allocations. Finally, it offers specific recommendations for PSGP stakeholders.},

Today when complex systems fail and mishaps occur, there is an initial tendency to attribute the failure to human error. Yet research has repeatedly shown that more often than not it is not human error but organizational factors that set up adverse conditions that increase the likelihood of system failure. Resilience engineering is concerned with building systems that are able to circumvent accidents through anticipation, survive disruptions through recovery, and grow through adaptation. This paper de- fines resilience from different perspectives, provides a conceptual framework for understanding and analyzing disruptions, and presents principles and heuristics based on lessons learned that can be employed to build resilient systems.},

abstract = {This study compares two widely used approaches for robustness analysis of decision problems: the info-gap method originally developed by Ben-Haim and the robust decision making (RDM) approach originally developed by Lempert, Popper, and Bankes. The study uses each approach to evaluate alternative paths for climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions given the potential for nonlinear threshold responses in the climate system, significant uncertainty about such a threshold response and a variety of other key parameters, as well as the ability to learn about any threshold responses over time. Info-gap and RDM share many similarities. Both represent uncertainty as sets of multiple plausible futures, and both seek to identify robust strategies whose performance is insensitive to uncertainties. Yet they also exhibit important differences, as they arrange their analyses in different orders, treat losses and gains in different ways, and take different approaches to imprecise probabilistic information. The study finds that the two approaches reach similar but not identical policy recommendations and that their differing attributes raise important questions about their appropriate roles in decision support applications. The comparison not only improves understanding of these specific methods, it also suggests some broader insights into robustness approaches and a framework for comparing them.},

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract. One strategy that systems employ to remain resilient in the face of shifting demands is the creation and maintenance of marginsof maneuver, cushions of potential actions and additional resources that allows the system to continue functioning despite unexpected demands. Systems are often comprised of units which have partial authority and autonomy to manage their individual margins of maneuver. In a study of emergency department interactions with other hospital units, we found that reorganizations to maintain margin could be classified into one of three categories: units could either defensively restrict the actions of other units or borrow margin from them, autonomously reorganize to create new margin, or cooperatively act with other units to exploit existing common pool resources and create new ones. The enumeration of the three classes of strategies to maintain margin of maneuver further explains how systems could reorganize themselves to remain resilient, and how they become brittle and fail. The influences on and interactions of each type of strategy are explored, and directions for future research to allow for better control of overall system margin, and hence resilience, are discussed.},

abstract = {Multiple stable states or alternative equilibria in ecological systems have been recognized since the 1960s in the ecological literature. Very often, the shift between alternative states occurs suddenly and the resource flows from these systems are modified. Resilience is the capacity of a system to undergo disturbance and maintain its functions and controls. It has multiple levels of meaning, from the metaphorical to the specific. However, most studies that explore resilience-related ideas have used resilience as a metaphor or theoretical construct. In a few cases, it has been defined operationally in the context of a model of a particular system. In this paper, resilience is defined consistently with the theoretical uses of the term, in the context of ecosystem models within an application to a simple model of lake eutrophication. The theoretical definitions of resilience and the characteristics of the operational definition that are necessary for ensuring consistency are reviewed. A mathematical formulation of resilience is built in the framework of the viability theory. This formulation emphasizes the link between resilience and the cost of the recovery after a disturbance. This cost is first chosen in relation to the time of crisis in the application to a model of lake eutrophication. The resilience values are then obtained by numerical integration. For another choice of the cost function, the viability algorithm is needed to compute the resilience values. These applications demonstrate the usefulness of our operational definition},

The IIM is based on Leontief’s input-output model, which characterizes interdependencies among sectors in the economy and analyzes initial disruptions to a set of sectors and the resulting ripple effects. An advantage of building on Leontief’s model is that it is supported by publications of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Independent computer runs of the IIM can represent the entire nation or sectors within particular U.S. regions. A dynamic extension of the IIM analyzes different temporal frames of recovery and characterizes the required sector adjustments for achieving new production levels. The IIM can systemically prioritize and manage the sectors deemed to be economically critical and also identify those sectors whose continued operability is critical during recovery. A companion paper demonstrates applying the IIM to attacks on electric power and telecommunications.},

The study shows that set-based projects can be driven within an existing organization, if given proper support. The participants claim that a set-based approach has a positive effects on development performance, especially on the level of innovation, product cost and performance. The improvements were achieved at the expense of slightly higher development costs and longer lead time.

Safety analysts can understand better the underlying causes of decision or action flaws by probing into the patterns of breakdown in the organization of safety. For this deeper analysis, a cybernetic model of organizational factors and a control model of human processes have been integrated in this article (i.e.; the viable system model and the extended control model). The joint VSM-ECOM framework has been applied to a case study to help safety practitioners with the analysis of patterns of breakdown with regard to how operators and organizations manage goal conflicts, monitor work progress, recognize weak signals, align goals across teams, and adapt plans on the fly. The recursive accident representation brings together several organizational issues (e.g.; the dilemma of autonomy versus compliance, or the interaction between structure and strategy) and addresses how operators adapt to challenges in their environment by adjusting their modes of functioning and recovery. Finally, it facilitates the transfer of knowledge from diverse incidents and near misses within similar domains of practice. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Analysis of a series of ecosystems—managed and unmanaged—indicates there are two additional functions. One is that of creative destruction where the tightly bound accumulation of biomass and nutrients is suddenly released by agents such as forest fires, insect pests, or intense grazing. The second function is one of renewal where released material is mobilized to become available for the next exploitive phase. That pattern is discontinuous and is dependent on the existence of multistable states. Resilience and recovery are emphasized during the release and renewal sequence, and stability and productivity during the exploitation and conservation sequence. Such studies of resilience are beginning to combine with hierarchy theory and with the theory of dissipative structures to deepen our understanding of change and how to manage change.},

When different activities create uncertain but correlated risk reductions, as is often the case in practice, then these principles are inconsistent: priority scoring and ranking fails to maximize risk-reduction benefits. Real-world risk priority scoring systems used in homeland security and terrorism risk assessment, environmental risk management, information system vulnerability rating, business risk matrices, and many other important applications do not exploit correlations among risk-reducing opportunities or optimally diversify risk-reducing investments. As a result, they generally make suboptimal risk management recommendations. Applying portfolio optimization methods instead of risk prioritization ranking, rating, or scoring methods can achieve greater risk-reduction value for resources spent.},

A model emphasizing differences in firm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm size in appropriating the returns from innovation is developed to explain the regularities. The model also explains regularities regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort, innovative productivity, cost, and profitability. It predicts that over time firms devote more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of product innovation eventually wither.},

@article{Gollier2010,
abstract = {Weitzman [1] showed that when future interest rates are uncertain, using the expected net present value implies a term structure of discount rates that is decreasing to the smallest possible interest rate. On the contrary, using the expected net future value criteria implies an increasing term structure of discount rates up to the largest possible interest rate. We reconcile the two approaches by introducing risk aversion and utility maximization. We show that if the aggregate consumption path is optimized and made flexible to news about future interest rates, the two criteria are equivalent. Moreover, they are also equivalent to the Ramsey rule extended to uncertainty. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The first of these is to set out emerging, and in our view, convincing evidence, that large world cities have political aspirations to develop purposive and managed change in the socio-technical organisation of infrastructure networks that can be characterised as 'systemic' transitions. The second objective is conceptual in orientation and seeks to address how we understand transitions at the scale of the city, the role of 'the city' in undertaking transitions, and review both the strengths and shortcomings of the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions in addressing this. The third objective is to identify what an urban transition would look like, and then constructs a new framework to conceptualise and research urban transitions. The paper then summarises the key aspects and implications of our argument. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The complexity of ecological systems requires investigators to deal with aggregates: individuals aggregated into populations or populations aggregated into communities or trophic levels. A number of theoretical studies have indicated the dangers of dealing with the dynamics of aggregated systems. These studies have focused on mathemattical models so the results have been of marginal interest to the fiedl ecologist. Practical criteria are developed which can be applied when the underlying model is unknown or of little immediate interest. This approach was to examine 40 alternative models and to state conclusions that are valid, no matter what the underlying dynamics of the system. No error is introduced when 2 components with identical turnover times are aggregated. For certain problems, the components can be aggregated with < 10{\%} error, even if the turnover rates differ by a factor of 3. Criteria can be stated even more practically in terms of the ratio between the standing crops of the components. When measurement errors are considered explicity, the criteria depend upon the accuracy with which aggregated and disaggregated measures can be estimated.},

abstract = {Resilience is the intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, during, or following changes and disturbances so that it can sustain required operations, even after a major mishap or in the presence of continuous stress. As an emergent property of systems that is not tied to tallies of adverse events or estimates of their probability, resilience provides the means for organizations to target resource investments by integrating safety and productivity concerns. Resilience engineering (RE) can enable an organization to cope with and recover from unexpected developments, such as maintaining the ability to adapt when demands go beyond an organization’s customary operating boundary. Understanding resilience makes the difference between organizations that inadvertently create complexity and miss signals that risks are increasing, and those that can manage high-hazard processes well. We discuss two examples of resilience: the response of an emergency department staff to surges in patient volume and design improvements to the infusion device control/display interface.},

@article{Carpenter2001,
abstract = {Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation.},

abstract = {In considering the human contribution to accidents, it seems necessary to make a distinction between errors and violations; two forms of aberration which may have different psychological origins and demand different modes of remediation. The present study investigated whether this distinction was justified for self-reported driver behaviour. Five hundred and twenty drivers completed a driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) which asked them to judge the frequency with which they committed various types of errors and violations when driving. Three fairly robust factors were identified: violations, dangerous errors, and relatively harmless lapses, respectively. Violations declined with age, errors did not. Men of all ages reported more violations than women. Women, however, were significantly more prone to harmless lapses (or more honest) than men. These findings were consistent with the view that errors and violations are indeed mediated by different psychological mechanisms. Violations require explanation in terms of social and motivational factors, whereas errors (slips, lapses, and mistakes) may be accounted for by reference to the information-processing characteristics of the individual.},

Oehmke characterizes this behavior as an anomaly which 'may make the net present value unsuitable for certain types of project-selection decisions.' This note shows how the NPV criterion can be applied in a specified subset of cases where there is no monotonic relationship between the NPV and the discount rate and only the interval of plausible discount rates is known. ??

abstract = {This paper reviews research traditions of vulnerability to environmental change and the challenges for present vulnerability research in integrating with the domains of resilience and adaptation. Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The general objective of the multiple-use management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework is to develop and demonstrate practical science-based methods that support, under existing statutory arrangements, integrated regional planning and management of coastal and marine ecosystems. In the present paper multiple-use MSE is focused on four sectors: oil and gas, conservation, fisheries, and urban and industrial development. A selection of cross-sectoral development scenarios, management strategies and computer representations, provided by the relevant interest groups, is represented. These include prospective future sectoral activities and their impacts, and the sectoral response to alternative management policies and strategies. The agent-based modelling software InVitro is well placed for analysing prospective social and ecological impacts of multiple-use management strategies in a risk-assessment framework such as MSE. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the tradeoffs that can be recognised and quantified using the MSE framework. The example explores the implications of a change in management strategy that not only has a direct impact on the targeted sectors, but also indirect impacts, not all of which are to be expected.

@article{Crutchfield1994,
abstract = {Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analyzed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtlely, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an inductive framework — hierarchical -machine reconstruction — in which the emergence of complexity is associated with the innovation of new computational model classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined. Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference resources drive the innovation of new structures and so lead to the emergence of complexity.},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {This article introduces a method for assessing health and safety management systems (MAHS) that has two innovative characteristics: (a) it brings together the three main auditing approaches to health and safety (HS) - the structural approach (which assesses the system prescribed), the operational approach (which assesses what is really happening on the shop-floor) and the performance approach (which assesses the results of performance indicators); (b) it emphasizes the resilience engineering perspective on HS, which takes into consideration four major principles (flexibility, learning, awareness, and top management commitment). Such principles underlie seven major assessment criteria, which in turn are divided into items (e.g. hazard identification from a resilience perspective is an item that belongs to the criteria of production processes). The items are sub-divided into statements, which are the requirements that should be assessed based on interviews, analysis of documents and direct observations. Within the 112 requirements proposed, 38 of them have clear links with at least one out of the four resilience engineering principles adopted. The remaining requirements are based on traditional assumptions underlying the so-called best practices of HS management. The results of the assessment for each item are expressed by a score on a scale of compliance with the established requirements, ranging from 0{\%} to 100{\%}. The specific score within that scale is obtained from tables used to assess applications for the Brazilian national quality award. The MAHS was tested in a case study that was carried out in a factory that manufactures automobile exhaust systems, located in Brazil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Critical infrastructures provide services that are essential for the support of everyday activities in modern societies. Being the result of a continuous process of integration of diverse technologies and organizations, they require a multi-disciplinary, systemic approach in order to be understood. In this respect, one of the most challenging issues is the analysis of infrastructures under disturbance or malfunctioning, and their ability to resist, react and recover, in a word the resilience. This paper presents a methodology of resilience analysis of systems of systems, with infrastructures as a special instance. A conceptual representation of the infrastructure, based on the functional relationships among its components, is given and then analyzed with respect to its structural and dynamic properties. Most critical and vulnerable components are identified. The response of the system to failure propagation is simulated in order to check if it is able to cope with them and recover in a resilient fashion. The analysis outcomes are used for a resilience-informed review of the infrastructure. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Adaptation is a process of deliberate change in anticipation of or in reaction to external stimuli and stress. The dominant research tradi tion on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the concept of disaster resilience through the de- velopment and application of quantitative measures. As the idea of building disaster-resilient communities gains acceptance, new methods are needed that go beyond estimating monetary losses and that address the complex, multiple dimensions of resilience. These dimensions include technical, organizational, social, and economic facets. This paper first proposes resilience measures that relate expected losses in future disasters to a community’s seismic per- formance objectives. It then demonstrates these measures in a case study of the Memphis, Tennessee, water delivery system. An existing earthquake loss estimation model provides a starting point for quantifying resilience. The analysis compares two seismic retrofit strategies and finds that only one im- proves community resilience over the status quo. However, it does not raise resilience to an adequate degree. The exercise demonstrates that the resilience framework can be valuable for guiding mitigation and preparedness efforts. However, to fully implement the concept, new research on resilience is needed that goes beyond loss estimation modeling.},

@article{Aven2011f,
abstract = {Recently, considerable attention has been paid to a systems-based approach to risk, vulnerability, and resilience analysis. It is argued that risk, vulnerability, and resilience are inherently and fundamentally functions of the states of the system and its environment. Vulnerability is defined as the manifestation of the inherent states of the system that can be subjected to a natural hazard or be exploited to adversely affect that system, whereas resilience is defined as the ability of the system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and to recover within an acceptable time, and composite costs, and risks. Risk, on the other hand, is probability based, defined by the probability and severity of adverse effects (i.e., the consequences). In this article, we look more closely into this approach. It is observed that the key concepts are inconsistent in the sense that the uncertainty (probability) dimension is included for the risk definition but not for vulnerability and resilience. In the article, we question the rationale for this inconsistency. The suggested approach is compared with an alternative framework that provides a logically defined structure for risk, vulnerability, and resilience, where all three concepts are incorporating the uncertainty (probability) dimension.},

We first review some early results in that field, with particular emphasis on the applications of correlation cleaning to portfolio optimisation, and discuss the extension of the Marcenko-Pastur (MP) distribution to a non trivial `true' underlying correlation matrix. We then present new results concerning different problems that arise in a financial context: (a) the generalisation of the MP result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM) constructed using exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the specific dynamics of the `market' eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector, which defines an interesting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and (c) the problem of the dependence of ECM's on the observation frequency of the returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-influences.},

abstract = {Markov models have traditionally been used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of competing health care technologies that require the description of patient pathways over extended time horizons. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a more flexible, but more complicated decision modelling technique, that can also be used to model extended time horizons. Through the application of a Markov process and a DES model to an economic evaluation comparing alternative adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer, this paper compares the respective processes and outputs of these alternative modelling techniques. DES displays increased flexibility in two broad areas, though the outputs from the two modelling techniques were similar. These results indicate that the use of DES may be beneficial only when the available data demonstrates particular characteristics.},

Vertical integration, an understanding of which serves as a paradigm for helping to unpack the puzzles of complex economic organization more generally, is described in the chapter. Some empirical tests of the transaction cost hypotheses are summarized in the chapter. Transaction cost economics adopts a contractual approach to the study of economic organization. As compared with other approaches to the study of economic organization, transaction cost economics (1) is more microanalytic, (2) is more self-conscious about its behavioral assumptions, (3) introduces and develops the economic importance of asset specificity, (4) relies more on comparative institutional analysis, (5) regards the business firm as a governance structure rather than a production function, (6) places greater weight on the ex post institutions of contract, with special emphasis on private ordering, and (7) works out of a combined law, economics, and organization perspective. Friction, the economic counterpart for which is transaction costs, is pervasive in both physical and economic systems.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to define the concept of resiliency as a component importance measure related to network reliability. Resiliency can be defined as a composite of: (1) the ability of a network to provide service despite external failures and (2) the time to restore service when in the presence of such failures. Although, Resiliency has been extensively studied in different research areas, this paper will study the specific aspects of quantifiable network resiliency when the network is experiencing potential catastrophic failures from external events and/or influences, and when it is not known a priori which specific components within the network will fail. A formal definition for Category I resiliency is proposed and a step-by-step approach based on Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate it is defined. To illustrate the approach, two-terminal networks with varying degrees of redundancy, have been considered. The results obtained for test networks show that this new quantifiable concept of resiliency provides insight into the performance and topology of the network. Future use for this work could include methods for safeguarding critical network components and optimizing the use of redundancy as a technique to improve network resiliency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Walker2004,
abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling’s (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system’s dynamics. Three related attributes of social– ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.},

These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social–ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience.},

In assessing a network’s potential performance given possible future disruptions, one must recognize the contributions of the network’s inherent ability to cope with disruption via its topological and operational attributes and potential actions that can be taken in the immediate aftermath of such an event. A two-stage stochastic program is formulated to solve the problem of measuring a network’s maximum resilience level and simultaneously determining the optimal set of preparedness and recovery actions necessary to achieve this level under budget and level-of-service constraints. An exact methodology, employing the integer L-shaped method and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed for its solution. In this dissertation, a nonlinear, stochastic, time-dependent integer program is proposed, from operational perspective, to schedule short-term recovery activities to maximize transportation network resilience. Two solution methods are proposed, both employing a decomposition approach to eliminate nonlinearities of the formulation. The first is an exact decomposition with branch-and-cut methodology, and the second is a hybrid genetic algorithm that evaluates each chromosome’s fitness based on optimal objective values to the time-dependent maximum flow subproblem. Algorithm performance is also assessed on a test network. Finally, this dissertation studies the role of network topology in resilience. 17 specific network topologies were selected for network resilience analysis. Simple graph structures with 9{\~{}}10 nodes and larger network with 100 nodes are assessed. Resilience is measured in terms of throughput and connectivity and average reciprocal distance. The integer L-shaped method is applied again to study the performance of the network structure with respect to all three resilience measures. The relationships between resilience and average degree, diameter, and cyclicity are also investigated.},

More specifically, the new regulation requires for an operator to implement a FRMS in the case of reduced rests. The FRMS is a data-driven system integrated in the future Safety Management System (SMS) of the airline. The whole process of the FRMS is described, including the use of predictive models of fatigue, a systematic and focused monitoring.

The mission succeeds if a specified amount of work can be accomplished within the maximum allowed mission time or deadline. The repair time is randomly distributed within a specified interval. Both failure and repair times are represented by known distributions. We first suggest a numerical algorithm to evaluate mission reliability, conditional expected cost and completion time of a successful mission. The backup frequency optimization problem is then formulated and solved for finding the inter-backup interval that maximizes mission reliability or minimizes expected mission cost while satisfying a desired level of mission reliability. Impacts of parameters including the maximum allowed mission time, data backup and retrieval times, repair and failure time distributions, and repair efficiency on mission reliability, cost and time as well as on the optimal solution are investigated through examples.},

@article{Furniss2011,
abstract = {Processes that enable an effective response to unexpected events and vulnerabilities that lie outside the scope of formal procedures can be described as being resilient. There are many such descriptions of resilience within and across different domains. Comparison and generalisation is difficult because resilience is not a component of a system and should be understood as an emergent property. Here we provide a framework for reasoning about resilience that requires representation of the level of analysis (from the individual to operational), a traceable link from abstract theory to specific observations, resilience mechanisms, and contextual factors. This moves forward an agenda to systematically observe concrete manifestations of resilience within and across domains. We illustrate the application of the framework by considering a case study of the performance of nuclear power plant (NPP) operators in an experimental scenario. This paper focuses on the small team level of analysis. The framework presented here provides the basis for developing concrete measures for improving the resilience of organisations through training, system design, and organisational learning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty in the potential dose calculation in this article serves to provide the information necessary to evaluate the reliability of decisions based on the HTP A framework for uncertainty analysis in multimedia risk assessment is proposed and evaluated with four types of uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty is assessed through Monte Carlo analysis. The variability in landscape parameters is assessed through a comparison of potential dose calculations for different regions in the United States. Decision rule uncertainty is explored through a comparison of the HTP values under open and closed system boundaries. Model uncertainty is evaluated through two case studies, one using alternative formulations for calculating the plant concentration and the other testing the steady state assumption for wet deposition. This investigation shows that steady state conditions for the removal of chemicals from the atmosphere are not appropriate and result in an underestimate of the potential dose for 25{\%} of the 336 chemicals evaluated.},

abstract = {Participatory methods to build local resilience often involve the organization of local community groups. When global organizations use such methods, it reflects a desire to incorporate local agency. They thereby acknowledge the ability of a society to be innovative and adapt when faced with natural disasters and climate change. In a globalized world, however, it is hard to discern what is "local" as global organizations play an increasingly visible and powerful role. This paper will argue that local understandings and practices of resilience cannot be disentangled from global understandings and practices. Rather, global organizations, while professing an interest in drawing on local agency, may inadvertently also influence recipients' perceptions of their own ability to be innovative and adapt, thereby limiting, as well as creating new spaces for, local agency. In the context of the 2007 severe flooding in northern Ghana, this paper examines the mutual construction of "local" and "global" notions and practices of resilience through multi-sited processes. It is based on interviews and participant observation in multiple sites at the "local," "regional" and "global" levels. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Wicked problems have no stopping rule 3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false but good-or-bad 4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem 5. Every solution to ,a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation" because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly 6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable set of potential solutions nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan. 7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique 8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem 9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution 10.

These adversarial communities are structured as self organized proactive collaborators in tight learning loops driving rapid innovation -- preying upon systems protected by wait and see strategies. In this paper we build upon six fundamental characteristics common to adversarial success, suggest that winning security can employ the same characteristics, show two patterns appropriate for resilient network support that fit this criteria, and describe a larger project that is developing a pattern language of next generation agile security. The two patterns described in this paper are modeled on the Biological Immune Systems and on mammalian hierarchical cortical sense making architecture. A technology that appears capable of implementing these patterns in relatively high biological fidelity is briefly introduced to support pattern-employment feasibility.},

We describe a general Bayesian approach for using a computer model or simulator of a complex system to forecast system outcomes. The approach is based on constructing beliefs derived from a combination of expert judgments and experiments on the computer model. These beliefs, which are systematically updated as we make runs of the computer model, are used for either Bayesian or Bayes linear forecasting for the system. Issues of design and diagnostics are described in the context of forecasting. The methodology is applied to forecasting for an active hydrocarbon reservoir.},

abstract = {In applied sciences there is a tendency to rely on terminology that is either ill-defined or applied inconsistently across areas of research and application domains. Examples in informa- tion assurance include the terms resilience, robustness and survivability, where there exists subtle shades of meaning between researchers. These nuances can result in confusion and misinterpretations of goals and results, hampering com- munication and complicating collaboration. In this paper, we propose security-related definitions for these terms. Us- ing this terminology, we argue that research in these areas must consider the functionality of the system holistically, beginning with a careful examination of what we actually want the system to do. We note that much of the published research focuses on a single aspect of a system – availability – as opposed to the system’s ability to complete its function without disclosing confidential information or, to a lesser extent, with the correct output. Finally, we discuss ways in which researchers can explore resilience with respect to integrity, availability and confidentiality.},

@article{Ferdous2011,
abstract = {Quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is a systematic approach for evaluating likelihood, consequences, and risk of adverse events. QRA based on event (ETA) and fault tree analyses (FTA) employs two basic assumptions. The first assumption is related to likelihood values of input events, and the second assumption is regarding interdependence among the events (for ETA) or basic events (for FTA). Traditionally, FTA and ETA both use crisp probabilities; however, to deal with uncertainties, the probability distributions of input event likelihoods are assumed. These probability distributions are often hard to come by and even if available, they are subject to incompleteness (partial ignorance) and imprecision. Furthermore, both FTA and ETA assume that events (or basic events) are independent. In practice, these two assumptions are often unrealistic. This article focuses on handling uncertainty in a QRA framework of a process system. Fuzzy set theory and evidence theory are used to describe the uncertainties in the input event likelihoods. A method based on a dependency coefficient is used to express interdependencies of events (or basic events) in ETA and FTA. To demonstrate the approach, two case studies are discussed.},

There is a tension between the original descriptive concept of resilience first defined in ecological science and a more recent, vague, and malleable notion of resilience used as an approach or boundary object by different scientific disciplines. Even though increased conceptual vagueness can be valuable to foster communication across disciplines and between science and practice, both conceptual clarity and practical relevance of the concept of resilience are critically in danger. The fundamental question is what conceptual structure we want resilience to have. This article argues that a clearly specified, descriptive concept of resilience is critical in providing a counterbalance to the use of resilience as a vague boundary object. A clear descriptive concept provides the basis for operationalization and application of resilience within ecological science.},

abstract = {Risk matrices-tables mapping "frequency" and "severity" ratings to corresponding risk priority levels-are popular in applications as diverse as terrorism risk analysis, highway construction project management, office building risk analysis, climate change risk management, and enterprise risk management (ERM). National and international standards (e.g., Military Standard 882C and AS/NZS 4360:1999) have stimulated adoption of risk matrices by many organizations and risk consultants. However, little research rigorously validates their performance in actually improving risk management decisions. This article examines some mathematical properties of risk matrices and shows that they have the following limitations. (a) Poor Resolution. Typical risk matrices can correctly and unambiguously compare only a small fraction (e.g., less than 10{\%}) of randomly selected pairs of hazards. They can assign identical ratings to quantitatively very different risks ("range compression"). (b) Errors. Risk matrices can mistakenly assign higher qualitative ratings to quantitatively smaller risks. For risks with negatively correlated frequencies and severities, they can be "worse than useless," leading to worse-than-random decisions. (c) Suboptimal Resource Allocation. Effective allocation of resources to risk-reducing countermeasures cannot be based on the categories provided by risk matrices. (d) Ambiguous Inputs and Outputs. Categorizations of severity cannot be made objectively for uncertain consequences. Inputs to risk matrices (e.g., frequency and severity categorizations) and resulting outputs (i.e., risk ratings) require subjective interpretation, and different users may obtain opposite ratings of the same quantitative risks. These limitations suggest that risk matrices should be used with caution, and only with careful explanations of embedded judgments.},

abstract = {Life arose on Earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after the young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from young Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a bayesian estimate of its posterior probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earth's history and that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact and considered its implications. We find that, given only this very limited empirical information, the choice of bayesian prior for the abiogenesis probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior probability. Although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence that life might be abundant in the universe if early-Earth-like conditions are common, the evidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily low intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors. Finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on Earth, elsewhere in the solar system, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide much stronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the universe.},

This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

(that this may not always be so is evidenced by the paucity of data relating to the effects of environmental pollution).  The second iassumption is that such historically revealed social preferences and costs are sufficiently enduring to permit their use for predcitvie purposes.  In the absence of economic or sociological theory which might give better results, this empirical approach provides some interesting insights into accepted social values relative to personal risk.  Because this methodology is based on historical data, it does not serve to distinguish what is "best" for society from what is "traditionally acceptable."},

abstract = {Some scholars of organization and strategy expend significant energy disparaging and defending various research methods. Debates about deductive versus inductive theory-building and the objectivity of information from field observation versus that of large-sample numerical data are dichotomies that surface frequently in our lives and those of our students. Despite this focus, some of the most respected members of our research profession (i.e., Simon (1976), Solow (1985), Hambrick (1994), Staw and Sutton (1995), and Hayes (2002)) have continued to express concerns that the collective efforts of business academics have produced a paucity of theory that is intellectually rigorous, practically useful, and able to stand the tests of time and changing circumstances. The purpose of this paper is to outline a process of theory building that links questions about data, methods and theory. We hope that this model can provide a common language about the research process that helps scholars of management better understand the roles of different types of data and research, and thereby to build more effectively on each others work. Our unit of analysis is at two levels: the individual research project and the iterative cycles of theory building in which a researchers attempt to build upon each others work. The model synthesizes and augments other studies of how communities of scholars cumulatively build valid and reliable theory.1 It has normative and pedagogical implications for how we conduct research, evaluate the work of others, train our doctoral students, and design our courses.},

abstract = {This paper examines how human performance factors in air traffic control (ATC) affect each other through their mutual interactions. The paper extends the conceptual SHEL model of ergonomics to describe the ATC system as human performance interfaces in which the air traffic controllers interact with other human performance factors including other controllers, software, hardware, environment, and organisation. New research hypotheses about the relationships between human performance interfaces of the system are developed and tested on data collected from air traffic controllers, using structural equation modelling. The research result suggests that organisation influences play a more significant role than individual differences or peer influences on how the controllers interact with the software, hardware, and environment of the ATC system. There are mutual influences between the controller-software, controller-hardware, controller-environment, and controller-organisation interfaces of the ATC system, with the exception of the controller-controller interface. Research findings of this study provide practical insights in managing human performance interfaces of the ATC system in the face of internal or external change, particularly in understanding its possible consequences in relation to the interactions between human performance factors.},

abstract = {A reliability allocation weight is used during the early design stage of a system to apportion the system reliability requirement to its individual subsystems. Since some failures have serious effects on public safety, cost and environmental issues especially in a mission critical system, the failure effect must be considered as one of the important factors in determining the allocation weight. Previously, the risk priority number or the criticality number was used to consider the failure effect in the allocation weight. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the previous approach and propose a new allocation weight based on the subsystem failure severity and its relative frequency. An example is given to illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than the previous method for reducing the occurrence of the unacceptable failure effects in a newly designed system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To aid in evaluating the dynamic behaviour of such systems we need to establish clearly elucidated performance criteria that encapsulate the attributes of resilience. A literature review establishes the latter as readiness, responsiveness and recovery. We also identify robustness as a necessary condition that would complement resilience. We find that the Integral of the Time Absolute Error (ITAE) is an appropriate control engineering measure of resilience when it is applied to inventory levels and shipment rates. We use the ITAE to evaluate an often used benchmark model of make-to-stock supply chains consisting of three decision parameters. We use both linear and nonlinear forms of the model in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that optimum solutions for resilience do not yield a system that is robust to uncertainties in lead-time. Hence supply chains will experience drastic changes in their resilience performance when lead-time changes.},

abstract = {Considering the variance and correlation of uncertain parameters, this study presents a new approach to computing net present value (NPV) of the financial processes. The changes of the uncertain parameters are postulated in a closed and convex region called the uncertainty region. The size and shape of the uncertainty region is selected based on the historical data and risk-taking or risk-aversion of the investor. The variance of cash flows is of high significance in analyzing the sensitivity of NPV. The model proposed in this study is highly reliable because of entering the covariance of historical data. In this study, using the robust approach, the mathematical formulation computing the robust NPV is presented. Programming of the presented robust NPV was done in C++ programming environment. The robust NPV is analyzed through presenting numerical examples. Simulating 10,000 random scenarios of uncertain parameters demonstrates that in circumstances where the traditional approach to computing NPV is doomed to a percentage of failure to make decisions, the robust approach never faces failure. The more positive the skewness in the scenarios produced, the higher is the probability of encountering failure in the traditional approach; whereas the robust approach still does not fail. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract. Bayesian inference is one of the more controversial approaches to
statistics. The fundamental objections to Bayesian methods are twofold: on one
hand, Bayesian methods are presented as an automatic inference engine, and this raises suspicion in anyone with applied experience. The second objection to Bayes comes from the opposite direction and addresses the subjective strand of Bayesian
inference. This article presents a series of objections to Bayesian inference, written in the voice of a hypothetical anti-Bayesian statistician. The article is intended to elicit elaborations and extensions of these and other arguments from non-Bayesians and responses from Bayesians who might have different perspectives on these issues.

@article{Bartell1988,
abstract = {A model that simulated the daily production of 100 theoretical algal populations was used to define a sampling universe for the construction and evaluation of aggregated models of phytoplankton community structure. Three model communities consisting of ten populations each were constructed by aggregating parameters from subsets of the original 100 population. Populations were aggregated accordign to different criteria: (1) correlations between their individual annual production and total annual production of all 100 populations, (2) correlations between individual population late summer production and total algal production during this period, and (3) similarities among model parameters that determined individual population growth rates. A fourth model community was constructed by classifying all 100 populations into four groups according to their individual seasonal patterns of growth. Cross comparisons of model performance with total community production values demonstrated that aggregates based on correlation with annual production reproduced total annual production within 6{\%} of the actual value. The community aggregate derived from seasonal patterns of individual population growth was the poorest overall predictor, underestimating total annual production by 24{\%} and late summer production by 4{\%}. The model community derived from late summer production underestimated total annual production by 18{\%}, but predicted summer production under simulated increased temperatures and nutrient availability within 1{\%} of the actual value. These aggregation exercises demonstrated the importance of identifying community structures in relation to the specific ecological question of interest and indicated the potential for inaccuracy when a model structure derived for a particular objective is more broadly applied},

@phdthesis{Peterson1999,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The second recommends that the student of economic organization be prepared to cross disciplinary boundaries if and as this is needed to preserve veridical contact with the phenomena.

The prevention and treatment of chronic wounds includes many strategies, including the use of various wound dressings, bandages, antimicrobial agents, footwear, physical therapies and educational strategies. This review is one of a series of reviews, and focuses on the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and the role of antimicrobial agents in chronic wounds in general. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of (1) prevention and treatment strategies for diabetic foot ulcers and (2) systemic and topical antimicrobial agents in the prevention and healing of chronic wounds. METHODS - DATA SOURCES: Nineteen electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Relevant journals, conference proceedings and bibliographies of retrieved papers were hand-searched. An expert panel was consulted. METHODS - STUDY SELECTION: Randomised and non-randomised trials with a concurrent control group, which evaluated any intervention for the prevention or treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, or systemic or topical antimicrobials for chronic wounds (diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, leg ulcers of various aetiologies, pilonidal sinuses, non-healing surgical wounds, and cavity wounds) and used objective measures of outcome such as: (1) development or resolution of callus; (2) incidence of ulceration (for diabetic foot ulcer prevention studies); (3) incidence of pressure sores (pressure sore prevention studies); (4) any objective measure of wound healing (frequency of complete healing, change in wound size, time to healing, rate of healing); (5) ulcer recurrence rates; (6) side-effects; (7) amputation rates (diabetic foot ulcer treatment studies); (8) healing rates and recurrence of disease, among others, for pilonidal sinuses. Studies reporting solely microbiological outcomes were excluded. Decisions on the inclusion of primary studies were made independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into structured summary tables. Data extraction was checked independently by a second reviewer and discrepancies resolved by discussion. All included studies were assessed against a comprehensive checklist for methodological quality. INCLUDED STUDIES - DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS: Thirty-nine trials which evaluated various prevention and treatment modalities for diabetic foot ulcers: footwear (2), hosiery (1), education (5), screening and foot protection programme (1); podiatry (1) for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers; and footwear (1), skin replacement (2), hyperbaric oxygen (2), ketanserin (3), prostaglandins (3), growth factors (5), dressings and topical applications (9), debridement (2) and antibiotics (2) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. INCLUDED STUDIES - ANTIMICROBIALS: Thirty studies were included, 25 with a randomised design. There were nine evaluations of systemic antimicrobials and 21 of topical agents. QUALITY OF STUDIES: The methodological and reporting quality was generally poor. Commonly encountered problems of reporting included lack of clarity about randomisation and outcome measurement procedures, and lack of baseline descriptive data. Common methodological weaknesses included: lack of blinded outcome assessment and lack of adjustment for baseline differences in important variables such as wound size; large loss to follow-up; and no intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS - PREVENTION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS: There is some evidence (1 large trial) that a screening and foot protection programme reduces the rate of major amputations. The evidence for special footwear (2 small trials) and educational programmes (5 trials) is equivocal. A single trial of podiatric care reported a significantly greater reduction in callus in patients receiving podiatric care. RESULTS - TREATMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS: Total contact casting healed significantly more ulcers than did standard treatment in one study. There is evidence from 5 trials of topical growth factors to suggest that these, particularly platelet-derived growth factor, may increase the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers. Although these studies were of relatively good quality, the sample sizes were far too small to make any definitive conclusions, and growth factors should be compared with current standard treatments in large, multicentre studies. Topical ketanserin increased ulcer healing rate in 2 studies, while systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduced the rate of major amputations in 1 study. Preliminary research into the effects of iloprost and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on diabetic foot ulcer healing suggests possible benefits. However, good quality, large-scale confirmatory research is needed. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

abstract = {Like other high hazard sectors, successful crisis response relies on a well-founded understanding of the work domain and the manner in which operators perceive and deal with obstacles to achieving goals. That understanding is essential to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) that are intended to support operator performance. While crises are uncommon in other high hazard sectors such as nuclear power generation and aviation, acute and ambulatory healthcare work encounters life-and-death crises daily. This makes healthcare a useful living laboratory to develop ICT in order to manage crises. This paper shows how healthcare organizations that continually deal with complex, uncertain, high-tempo operations can serve as a model to develop ICT that supports crisis management. We illustrate the results of using these methods through an example of cognitive systems engineering research that identifies ambulatory care risks to patients. We then describe multiple methods that can be used together to efficiently study complex, high hazard work settings. We conclude with an example of how it can support the development of a cognitive aid for diabetic care to support work in that setting.},

abstract = {Vulnerability to sudden service disruptions due to deliberate sabotage and terrorist attacks is one of the major threats of today. In this paper, we present a bilevel formulation of the r-interdiction median problem with fortification (RIMF). RIMF identifies the most cost-effective way of allocating protective resources among the facilities of an existing but vulnerable system so that the impact of the most disruptive attack to r unprotected facilities is minimized. The model is based upon the classical p-median location model and assumes that the efficiency of the system is measured in terms of accessibility or service provision costs. In the bilevel formulation, the top level problem involves the decisions about which facilities to fortify in order to minimize the worst-case efficiency reduction due to the loss of unprotected facilities. Worst-case scenario losses are modeled in the lower-level interdiction problem. We solve the bilevel problem through an implicit enumeration (IE) algorithm, which relies on the efficient solution of the lower-level interdiction problem. Extensive computational results are reported, including comparisons with earlier results obtained by a single-level approach to the problem. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The label resilience has been used in the field of child psychology and of child development to identify the way in which children could cope with adverse events of their past, in order to live (to develop) “normal” lives. In this field, the following definition is in use: "children resilience is a universal capacity which allows a person, group or community to prevent, minimize or overcome the damaging effects of adversity." (Grotberg, 1997). It is interesting to note that the concepts as discussed in the collective book on resilience engineering (Hollnagel, Woods {\&} Leveson, 20061) share some similarities with the methodological and theoretical developments found in the child resilience field. Three examples of these similarities are discussed here. First we discuss the cross disciplinary nature of the child and organisational resilience. Secondly, we discuss the similarities between the risk factors versus resilience factors in both fields. And finally, we introduce the importance of the cognitive and social construction of safety.},

abstract = {In most research on redundancy allocation problem (RAP), the redundancy strategy for each subsystem is assumed to be predetermined and fixed. This paper focuses on a specific RAP with multiple strategy choices (RAP-MSC), in which both active redundancy and cold standby redundancy can be selected as an additional decision variable for individual subsystems. To do so, the component type, redundancy strategy and redundancy level for each subsystem should be chosen subject to the system constraints appropriately such that the system reliability is maximized. Meanwhile, imperfect switching for cold standby redundancy is considered and a k-Erlang distribution is introduced to model the time-to-failure component as well. Given the importance and complexity of RAP-MSC, we propose a new efficient simplified version of particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to solve such NP-hard problems. In this method, a new position updating scheme without velocity is presented with stochastic disturbance and a low probability. Moreover, it is compared with several well-known PSO variants and other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature to evaluate its performance. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of SPSO as an alternative for solving the RAP-MSC.},

But instead of studying the ecological and economic interactions in terms of equilibrium or optimal control, we pay much attention to the viability of the system or, in a symmetric way, to crisis situations. These viability/crisis situations are defined by a set of economic and biological state constraints. The analytical study focuses on the compatibility between the state constraints and the controlled dynamics. Using the mathematical concept of viability kernel, we reveal the situations and, if possible, management options to guarantee a perennial system. Going further, we define 'overexploitation' indicators by the time of crisis function. In particular, we point out irreversible overexploitation configurations related to the resource extinction. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Extending economic transaction cost theory into the public and the interorganizational domains suggests that both economic and political markets do not need planning, since planning is associated with nonmarket hierarchical forms of organization and organizational systems. The transaction cost theory of planning accounts for planning in the public and private sectors alike and offers a link between planning, coordination, and implementation. Perhaps it also raises questions that may stimulate exploration of the relation between organizational and interorganizational structures and planning processes.},

abstract = {This paper is a work-in-progress account of ideas and propositions about resilience in social-ecological systems. It articulates our understanding of how these complex systems change and what determines their ability to absorb disturbances in either their ecological or their social domains. We call them "propositions" because, although they are useful in helping us understand and compare different social-ecological systems, they are not sufficiently well defined to be considered formal hypotheses. These propositions were developed in two workshops, in 2003 and 2004, in which participants compared the dynamics of 15 case studies in a wide range of regions around the world. The propositions raise many questions, and we present a list of some that could help define the next phase of resilience-related research.},

abstract = {{\{}In military applications, it is important for a platform (warship, aircraft, etc.) or an installation (airbase, etc.) to maintain war fighting ability after being damaged. In particular, if the unit requires electric power, cooling, or other resources to perform its mission, then these resources must be available following a weapon detonation event. The integrated engineering plant is responsible for providing these services to the mission critical loads in a unit. Novel continuity of service metrics for integrated engineering plants are set forth. These metrics provide a quantitative means of predicting the worst case scenario for a given system, as well as the level of service the plant can provide under the worst case scenario. This provides a method of making meaningful comparisons between different designs. The computation and meaning of the proposed metrics are explored using the notional plant.{\}}, keywords={\{}battle damage response;electric warship integrated engineering plant;fighting ability;integrated engineering plants;military applications;performance metrics;weapon detonation event;electric vehicles;military vehicles;power stations;ships;weapons;{\}}},

This is motivating the search for universal laws of highly evolved systems and driving demand for new mathematics and methods that are consistent, integrative, and predictive. However, the theoretical frameworks available today are not merely fragmented but sometimes contradictory and incompatible. We argue that complexity arises in highly evolved biological and technological systems primarily to provide mechanisms to create robustness. However, this complexity itself can be a source of new fragility, leading to {\&}amp;{\#}x201C;robust yet fragile{\&}amp;{\#}x201D; tradeoffs in system design. We focus on the role of robustness and architecture in networked infrastructures, and we highlight recent advances in the theory of distributed control driven by network technologies. This view of complexity in highly organized technological and biological systems is fundamentally different from the dominant perspective in the mainstream sciences, which downplays function, constraints, and tradeoffs, and tends to minimize the role of organization and design.},

abstract = {Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), considerable efforts have been made to estimate the risks of terrorism and the cost effectiveness of security policies to reduce these risks. DHS, industry, and the academic risk analysis communities have all invested heavily in the development of tools and approaches that can assist decisionmakers in effectively allocating limited resources across the vast array of potential investments that could mitigate risks from terrorism and other threats to the homeland. Decisionmakers demand models, analyses, and decision support that are useful for this task and based on the state of the art. Since terrorism risk analysis is new, no single method is likely to meet this challenge. In this article we explore a number of existing and potential approaches for terrorism risk analysis, focusing particularly on recent discussions regarding the applicability of probabilistic and decision analytic approaches to bioterrorism risks and the Bioterrorism Risk Assessment methodology used by the DHS and criticized by the National Academies and others.},

In order to provide a still a safe system in this situation, several concerted activities are initiated which are bound into the ESARR framework (ESARR means European Safety Regulatory Requirements). As part of the ESARR framework, quantitative safety assessment of a planned system change needs to be conducted, which addresses technological, procedural and human contributions to safety performance. However, the power of quantitative risk assessment is depending on the power of the risk assessment methods used. Regarding Human reliability often old fashioned method are used which predetermine misleading safety improvements as they result from a systematical mis-assessment of the human contribution to risk and safety. The resilience principles are used to define a better approach to Human Reliability Assessment (HRA). Note that the paper does not propose to merge Human Reliability and Resilience but to apply the resilience principles to inclusion of Human Reliability Assessment into safety assessments.},

D-N curves were found useful to identify the condition of incipient collapse due to the nucleation and propagation of fatigue cracks on steel. It is possible to use the fractal dimension as a damage parameter. In all tested specimens, the crisis occurs within the same range of values of fractal dimension. The results suggest that it is possible to anticipate the detection of crack beginning relating to the other theoretical or experimental techniques. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The number of publications in the three knowledge domains increased rapidly between 1995 and 2005. However, the resilience knowledge domain is only weakly connected with the other two domains in terms of co-authorships and citations. The resilience knowledge domain has a background in ecology and mathematics with a focus on theoretical models, while the vulnerability and adaptation knowledge domains have a background in geography and natural hazards research with a focus on case studies and climate change research.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new multi-stage framework to analyze infrastructure resilience. For each stage, a series of resilience-based improvement strategies are highlighted and appropriate correlates of resilience identified, to then be combined for establishing an expected annual resilience metric adequate for both single hazards and concurrent multiple hazard types. Taking the power transmission grid in Harris County, Texas, USA, as a case study, this paper compares an original power grid model with several hypothetical resilience-improved models to quantify their effectiveness at different stages of their response evolution to random hazards and hurricane hazards. Results show that the expected annual resilience is mainly compromised by random hazards due to their higher frequency of occurrence relative to hurricane hazards. In addition, under limited resources, recovery sequences play a crucial role in resilience improvement, while under sufficient availability of resources, deploying redundancy, hardening critical components and ensuring rapid recovery are all effective responses regardless of their ordering. The expected annual resilience of the power grid with all three stage improvements increases 0.034{\%} compared to the original grid. Although the improvement is small in absolute magnitude due to the high reliability of real power grids, it can still save millions of dollars per year as assessed by energy experts. This framework can provide insights to design, maintain, and retrofit resilient infrastructure systems in practice.},

abstract = {The study of the interdependencies within critical infrastructures (CI) is a growing field of research as the importance of potential failure propagation among infrastructures may lead to cascades affecting all supply networks. New powerful methods are required to model and describe such systems-of-systems (SoS) as a whole. An overall model is required to provide security and reliability assessment taking into account various kinds of threats and failures. A significant challenge associated with this model may be to create what-if scenarios for the analysis of interdependencies. In this paper the interdependencies between industrial control systems (ICS), in particular SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and the underlying critical infrastructures to address the vulnerabilities related to the coupling of these systems are analyzed. The modeling alternatives for system-of-systems, integrated versus coupled models, are discussed. An integrated model contains detailed low level models of (sub)systems as well as a high level model, covering all hierarchical levels. On the other hand, a coupled model aggregates different simulated outputs of the low level models as inputs at a higher level. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches are analyzed and a model architecture for SCADA and the system under control are proposed. Furthermore, the HLA simulation standard is introduced and discussed in this paper as a promising approach to represent interdependencies between infrastructures. To demonstrate the capabilities of the HLA standard for the interdependencies study, an exemplary application and some first results are also briefly presented in this paper. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The domain of risk analysis is expanded to consider strategic interactions among multiple participants in the management of extreme risk in a system of systems. These risks are fraught with complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty, which pose challenges in how participants perceive, understand, and manage risk of extreme events. In the case of extreme events affecting a system of systems, cause-and-effect relationships among initiating events and losses may be difficult to ascertain due to interactions of multiple systems and participants (complexity). Moreover, selection of threats, hazards, and consequences on which to focus may be unclear or contentious to participants within multiple interacting systems (ambiguity). Finally, all types of risk, by definition, involve potential losses due to uncertain events (uncertainty). Therefore, risk analysis of extreme events affecting a system of systems should address complex, ambiguous, and uncertain aspects of extreme risk. To accomplish this, a system of systems engineering methodology for risk analysis is proposed as a general approach to address extreme risk in a system of systems. Our contribution is an integrative and adaptive systems methodology to analyze risk such that strategic interactions among multiple participants are considered. A practical application of the system of systems engineering methodology is demonstrated in part by a case study of a maritime infrastructure system of systems interface, namely, the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.},

@article{Mandelbrot1984,
abstract = {When a piece of metal is fractured either by tensile or impact loading (pulling or hitting), the fracture surface that is formed is rough and irregular. Its shape is affected by the metal's microstructure (such as grains, inclusions and precipitates, whose characteristic length is large relative to the atomic scale), as well as by 'macrostructural' influences (such as the size, the shape of the specimen, and the notch from which the fracture begins). However, repeated observation at various magnifications also reveals a variety of additional structures that fall between the 'micro' and the 'macro' and have not yet been described satisfactorily in a systematic manner. The experiments reported here reveal the existence of broad and clearly distinct zone of intermediate scales in which the structure is modelled very well by a fractal surface. A new method, slit island analysis, is introduced to estimate the basic quantity called the fractal dimension, D. The estimate is shown to agree with the value obtained by fracture profile analysis, a spectral method. Finally, D is shown to be a measure of toughness in metals.},

abstract = {Infrastructures are needed for maintaining functionality and stability of society, while being put under substantial stresses from natural or man-made shocks. Since avoiding shock is impossible, increased focus is given to infrastructure resilience, which denotes the ability to recover and operate under new stable regimes. This paper addresses the problem of estimating, quantifying and planning for economic resilience of interdependent infrastructures, where interconnectedness adds to problem complexity. The risk-based economic input-output model enterprise, a useful tool for measuring the cascading effects of interdependent failures, is employed to introduce a framework for economic resilience estimation. We propose static and dynamic measures for resilience that confirm to well-known resilience concepts of robustness, rapidity, redundancy, and resourcefulness. The quantitative metrics proposed here (static resilience metric, time averaged level of operability, maximum loss of functionality, time to recovery) guide a preparedness decision making framework to promote interdependent economic resilience estimation. Using the metrics we introduce new multi-dimensional resilience functions that allow multiple resource allocation scenarios. Through an example problem we demonstrate the usefulness of these functions in guiding resource planning for building resilience. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For each attack, a contest intensity measures whether the agents' efforts have low or high impact on the target vulnerability (low vs. high contest intensity). Both the defender and the attacker have limited resources. It is assumed that the attacker can observe the outcome of each attack and stop the sequence of attacks when the target is destroyed. Two attacker objectives are considered, that is, to maximize the target vulnerability or to minimize the expected attacker resource expenditure. The article addresses the following three questions: whether the attacker should allocate its entire resource into one large attack or distribute it among several attacks; whether geometrically increasing or decreasing resource distribution into a fixed number of sequential attacks is more beneficial than equal resource distribution; and how the optimal attack strategy depends on the contest intensity.},

@article{Geels2005a,
abstract = {This article deals with the systems level in Freeman and Perez's innovation typology (incremental, radical, system, techno-economic paradigm). Transitions at this level are understood as changes from one socio-technical system to another, involving co-evolution of technology and society. To understand these transitions, the article describes a multi-level perspective, based on insights from sociology of technology and evolutionary economics. This perspective is used to analyse a detailed historical case study, the transition from surface water to piped water and personal hygiene (1870-1930). By the middle of the 19th century, problems in the water supply regime grew worse, as expanding urban populations dumped their waste in canals and surface waters. Local conditions in some specific cities provided space for the first piped water systems in the 1850s. Problems in the water supply regime grew worse in the 1860s and 1870s, but public authorities in other cities did not embrace the new niche. Instead, they searched for solutions within the existing regime. Only after wider landscape developments in the 1880s and 1890s (economic, cultural, political) could the niche break through and trigger wider transformations. So external macro-developments played a crucial role in the take-off and diffusion phase of this transition. This transition is a good example of co-evolution of technology and society, involving technological innovations, such as piped water infrastructure, soap, toilets, baths, as well as cultural, political, economic and behavioural changes. The case study illustrates how the multi-level perspective can be used to analyse how these changes influenced each other in a co-evolution process. The article thus fits in the growing literature on co-evolution. While most literatures look at co-evolution between two or three aspects, this article develops a broader understanding of co-evolution. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

It is often costly to conduct full system tests. As such, we present a review of methodology that has been proposed for addressing system reliability with limited full system testing. The first approaches presented in this paper are concerned with the combination of multiple sources of information to assess the reliability of a single component. The second general set of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to determine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems beyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian networks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to resource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We illustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos National Laboratory.},

abstract = {Expert knowledge is an important source of input to risk analysis. In practice, experts might be reluctant to characterize their knowledge and the related (epistemic) uncertainty using precise probabilities. The theory of possibility allows for imprecision in probability assignments. The associated possibilistic representation of epistemic uncertainty can be combined with, and transformed into, a probabilistic representation; in this article, we show this with reference to a simple fault tree analysis. We apply an integrated (hybrid) probabilistic-possibilistic computational framework for the joint propagation of the epistemic uncertainty on the values of the (limiting relative frequency) probabilities of the basic events of the fault tree, and we use possibility-probability (probability-possibility) transformations for propagating the epistemic uncertainty within purely probabilistic and possibilistic settings. The results of the different approaches (hybrid, probabilistic, and possibilistic) are compared with respect to the representation of uncertainty about the top event (limiting relative frequency) probability. Both the rationale underpinning the approaches and the computational efforts they require are critically examined. We conclude that the approaches relevant in a given setting depend on the purpose of the risk analysis, and that further research is required to make the possibilistic approaches operational in a risk analysis context.},

@article{Wears2010,
abstract = {Resilience is a way of behaving seen in complex work systems, whereby they are able to largely meet their fundamental goals despite threats and challenges to their work and even their existence. It is not something a system has, but rather something a system does, or even more specifically, the way in which a system does what it does. Because resilient behaviour (or lack thereof) is manifested over time, the dynamics of resilience are of interest. Studies of resilience to date have been largely descriptive, but understanding of how resilient performance comes about, and especially how we might enhance it, or recognize that a system is losing it, has been difficult. This work uses system dynamics models to develop inductively a theory of activities resulting in resilient performance in complex systems, and to elaborate on previous representations of system resilience. Such models might be useful in two ways: explaining how resilient behaviours observed might come about; and exploring the temporal dynamics of changes in state (for example, suggesting leading rather than lagging indicators of performance).},

abstract = {We explore the social dimension that enables adaptive ecosystem-based management. The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of "bridging organizations" seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts. A resilient social-ecological system may make use of crisis as an opportunity to transform into a more desired state.},

abstract = {Ten years ago, decision analysis was still an experimental management technique. But even then supporters claimed that eventually it would become for the manager what calculus is to the engineer. According to the authors of this article, decision analysis that incorporates personal judgment has not yet become what some expected, but it has, nonetheless, gained acceptance in many large corporations and government departments. One of the reasons for this acceptance is the greater flexibility and sensitivity of decision analysis to managers' needs than earlier forms had. In other words, today's decision analysis techniques can better take into account the people, the politics, the time pressures, and all the messy but critical factors that managers have to contend with. In this article, the authors describe three major forms of decision analysis and show how real managers have used decision tree analysis, probabilistic forecasting, and multiattribute analysis to solve real business problems.},

@article{Lundberg2006,
abstract = {The concept of ‘resilience’ is often absent in accident investigations, most likely because one of the central notions in resilience, ‘requisite imagination’, seems to be of limited utility when used in hindsight. In this paper we argue that requisite imagination is often a mirage, and that its false promise may well be based on treating stability and resilience as one unified concept. It is important to see the distinction between recommendations from accident investigations that aim at maintaining the ability to respond to known disturbances, (stability) and recommendations aimed at increasing the ability to cope with irregular and unexampled events (resilience). Instead of attempting to maximize resilience and stability at the same time, it may be more fruitful to try to balance these properties of a system. Thus, in accident investigation a safety perspective should include both traditional stabilityenhancing perspectives as well as a resilience perspective},

CCNP creates a cooperative communication platform to support critical services across a range of business sectors. CCNP is based on the personal network (PN) technology which is an inherently cooperative environment prototyped in the Dutch Freeband PNP2008 and the European Union IST MAGNET projects. In CCNP, the cognitive control plane strives to exploit the resources to better satisfy the requirements of networked applications. CCNP facilitates collaboration inherently. Through cognition in the cognitive control plane, CCNP becomes a self-managed substrate. The self-managed substrate, in this paper, is defined as cognitive and collaborative middleware on which future applications run without user intervention. Endemic sensor networks may be incorporated into the CCNP concept to feed its cognitive control plane. In this paper, we present the CCNP concept and discuss the research challenges related to collaboration and cognition.},

METHODS: A review of the available approaches to modelling in the economic evaluation of health care interventions with a leading discussion of examples of published studies leading to guidance in the selection of an appropriate approach in different circumstances. RESULTS: The main approaches to modelling used in economic evaluations in health care are decision trees, Markov models and individual sampling models. These methods assume independence of individuals within the model. Where interaction between individuals is important, other methods such as discrete-event simulation or system dynamics are preferable. CONCLUSIONS: The paper highlights the crucial question to be answered when selecting the approach to modelling: can the individuals being simulated in the model be regarded as independent? This issue is very commonly not recognised by analysts but is fundamental to the appropriate application of modelling in economic evaluation.},

@article{Woods2010,
abstract = {Abstract Advances in technologies for networking, sensing, and automation have resulted in multi-layered networked systems that extend information gathering, interactions across roles, and the potential for control over wider ranges. But these systems also represent a scale shift in complexity in terms of the density of interdependencies across processes and activities. In the new systems, coupling has run amok introducing new challenges about how to control processes when they are part of such highly interdependent webs. Based on the joint cognitive systems perspective, Hollnagel examines, or tests, technology changes by asking two key questions: what does it mean to be in control and how can control be amplified? Hollnagel has shown that the answers to these questions are not inherent in technology itself but rather point to emergent system properties that can and should be supported to produce success and avoid failures. This paper applies Hollnagel’s test to the reverberations of technology change that are producing multi-layered networked systems. The paper shows how being ‘in control’ of multi-layered networked systems requires the ability to navigate interdependencies and shows how ‘amplifying control’ then consists of tools that help reveal/track relevant interdependencies and help anticipate how projected actions will propagate (resonate) across interdependencies relative to goals. The end result is that a shift is underway from supervisory control to polycentric control architectures.},

@article{Pant2014,
abstract = {Abstract While early research efforts were devoted to the protection of systems against disruptive events, be they malevolent attacks, man-made accidents, or natural disasters, recent attention has been given to the resilience, or the ability of systems to "bounce back," of these events. Discussed here is a modeling paradigm for quantifying system resilience, primarily as a function of vulnerability (the adverse initial system impact of the disruption) and recoverability (the speed of system recovery). To account for uncertainty, stochastic measures of resilience are introduced, including Time to Total System Restoration, Time to Full System Service Resilience, and Time to $\alpha${\%}-Resilience. These metrics are applied to quantify the resilience of inland waterway ports, important hubs in the flow of commodities, and the port resilience approach is deployed in a data-driven case study for the inland Port of Catoosa in Oklahoma. The contributions herein demonstrate a starting point in the development of a resilience decision making framework. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using linear impact functions, the problems of allocating a limited resource to defend sites that face either probabilistic risk or strategic risk are formulated as optimization problems that are solved explicitly. The resulting optimal policies differ - under probabilistic risk, the optimal policy is to focus the investment of resources on priority sites where they yield the highest impact, while under strategic risk, the best policy is to spread the resources so as to decrease the potential damage level of the most vulnerable site(s). Neither solution coincides with the commonly practiced proportionality allocation scheme. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper shows that no simple, common-sense rule of thumb can be used to identify a most-vital arc, even in a simple maximum-flow problem. The correct answer requires analysis equivalent in difficulty to completely solving the maximum-flow problem, perhaps repeatedly. This insight generalizes to finding a most-vital component, or set of components, in a system whose operation is described by a more general model. Our paper shows how to evaluate the criticality of sets of components, how to assess the worst-case set of components that might be lost to a given number of simultaneous hostile attacks (or engineering failures, or losses to Mother Nature), and how to allocate limited defensive resources to minimize the maximum damage from a subsequent attack. Collateral insights include the fact that there is no way to prioritize individual components by criticality, and that the analysis that determines critical component sets also yields objective assessments of operational system resilience and can provide constructive advice on how to increase it.},

abstract = {A System-of-Systems (SoS) is a collection of distributed independent individual systems that interact with one another to achieve an SoS capability requirement that cannot be achieved by individual systems alone (in contrast, in a monolithic system, hardware or software components are integrated to form a single entity). Interdependency between SoS systems, while enabling new capability, also means that failures can cascade throughout the SoS, creating development delays or additional system failures. Here we develop a method based on Bayesian networks to evaluate the resilience of SoS design alternatives to failures during operations. We propose a conditional resilience metric that measures each constituent system's contribution to overall SoS resilience, and a resilience pattern that shows how SoS performance degrades as systems fail. SoS resilience is determined by both the SoS architecture and the constituent system reliability. In a simple example based on the Littoral Combat Ship SoS, we determine the two most critical systems using the conditional resilience metric. Adding a communications link between these two systems increases the resilience, resulting in higher expected performance and slower expected performance degradation as a result of system failure. The conditional resilience and resilience pattern can be used by designers and other decision makers to identify SoS architectures and systems that increase SoS resilience to failure.},

The results indicate that indirect effects in the context of general equilibrium analysis are moderate in size. The stronger factor, and one that pushes in the opposite direction, is resilience. Our analysis indicates that electricity customers have the ability to mute the potential shock to their business operations by as much as 86{\%}. Moreover, market resilience lowers the losses, in part through the dampening of general equilibrium effects.},

abstract = {Credit risk is the potential exposure of a creditor to an obligor's failure or refusal to repay the debt in principal or interest. The potential of exposure is measured in terms of probability of default. Many models have been developed to estimate credit risk, with rating agencies dating back to the 19th century. They provide their assessment of probability of default and transition probabilities of various firms in their annual reports. Regulatory capital requirements for credit risk outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have made it essential for banks and financial institutions to develop sophisticated models in an attempt to measure credit risk with higher accuracy. The Bayesian framework proposed in this article uses the techniques developed in physical sciences and engineering for dealing with model uncertainty and expert accuracy to obtain improved estimates of credit risk and associated uncertainties. The approach uses estimates from one or more rating agencies and incorporates their historical accuracy (past performance data) in estimating future default risk and transition probabilities. Several examples demonstrate that the proposed methodology can assess default probability with accuracy exceeding the estimations of all the individual models. Moreover, the methodology accounts for potentially significant departures from "nominal predictions" due to "upsetting events" such as the 2008 global banking crisis.},

abstract = {This paper explores the identification of leading indicators in aviation maintenance. Traditionally, improvements in aviation have been based on incident reporting and analyses and learning from failures. This traditional approach measures safety performance based on lagging indicators. However, there is a growing concern that this information does not provide the requisite information and insight to prevent future accidents. Resilience has been identified as the ability of the system to adjust prior, during and after a major mishap. This implies a need to recognize early signals to be able to anticipate and act properly. The objective of the paper is to understand leading indicators and the “why” behind the leading indicator as basis to look forward in monitoring safety performance. With regard to the leading indicator definition applied to aviation and maintenance in the context of resilience, we focus on learning from success and failures and propose: Leading indicators are precursors based on a model of safety implying a significant possibility of a subsequent event that has an impact on safety and performance. Leading indicators can therefore provide information about changes in risk before traditional risk analyses are able to capture this change},

abstract = {Embedded systems development creates a need of new design, verification and validation technics. Formal methods appear as a very interesting approach for embedded systems analysis, especially for dependability studies. The chosen formalism for this work is based on Colored Petri Net (CPN) for two main reasons: the expressivity and the formal nature. Also, they model easily the static and the dynamic natures of the studied systems. The main challenge of this work is to use existing models, which describe the system structure and/or behavior, to extract the dependability information in a most general case and failure diagnosis information in a particular case. The proposed approach is a CPN structural backward reachability analysis. It can be split into two parts. The first one is to perform the proposed analysis: inverse CPN. It is obtained thanks to structural transformations applied on the original CPN. The second part is the analysis implementation. This part needs some complementary concepts. Among them, the most important is the marking enhancement. The proposed approach is studied under two complementary aspects: algorithmic and theoretic aspects. The first one proposes transformations for the CPN inversion and the analysis implementation. The second aspect (the theoretical one) aims to offer a formal proof for the approach by applying two methods which are linear algebra and Linear Logic. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mitigation decreases the losses from natural hazards by reducing our vulnerability or by reducing the frequency and magnitude of causal factors. Reducing these losses brings many benefits, but every mitigation activity has a cost that must be considered in our world of limited resources. In principle, benefit-cost analysis (BCA) attempts to assess a mitigation activity's expected net benefits (discounted future benefits less discounted costs), but in practice this often proves difficult. This paper reports on a study that applied BCA methodologies to a statistical sample of the nearly 5,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mitigation grants between 1993 and 2003 for earthquake, flood, and wind hazards. HAZUS MH was employed to assess the benefits, with and without FEMA mitigation in regions across the country, for a variety of hazards with different probabilities and severities. The results indicate that the overall benefit-cost ratio for FEMA mitigation grants is about 4:1, though the ratio varies from 1.5 for earthquake mitigation to 5.1 for flood mitigation. Sensitivity analysis was conducted and shows these estimates to be quite robust.},

abstract = {Arguments over public policy typically turn out to hinge on disagreements about public values. Often, those in conflict may agree about what the relevant dimensions of value are. The conflicts arise over the relative importance of various goals. Normally, such disagreements are fought out in the contexts of specific decisions, and so are fought out over and over again, at enormous social cost each time another decision must be made. This paper proposes a method that can spell out explicitly what each individual's or group's values are, showing how and how much they differ-and in the process can frequently reduce the extent of such differences. It presents data illustrating the application of this technology, multiattribute utility measurement, to two specific instances: management of the coastal zone of the town of Venice, a part of Los Angeles, CA; and selection of research programs for the Office of Child Development, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In both cases, exploitation of multiattribute utility measurement permits the decisionmaking or regulatory agencies to shift their attention from the specific actions, being regulated to the values these actions serve and the decisionmaking mechanisms that implement these values. In the process, the data show that degree of disagreement about values among holders of conflicting value systems are often reduced.},

An application is considered with regards to the scenarios generated following a steam generator tube rupture in a nuclear power plant. The scenarios are generated by the accident dynamic simulator (ADS), coupled to a RELAP code that simulates the thermo-hydraulic behavior of the plant and to an operators' crew model, which simulates their cognitive and procedures-guided responses. A set of 60 scenarios has been generated by the ADS DET tool. The classification approach has grouped the 60 scenarios into 4 classes of dominant scenarios, one of which was not anticipated a priori but was "discovered" by the classifier. The proposed approach may be considered as a first effort towards the application of identification and classification approaches to scenarios post-processing for real-scale dynamic safety assessments.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

abstract = {A performance theory for conflict detection in air traffic control is presented that specifies how controllers adapt decisions to compensate for environmental constraints. This theory is then used as a framework for a model that can fit controller intervention decisions. The performance theory proposes that controllers apply safety margins to ensure separation between aircraft. These safety margins are formed through experience and reflect the biasing of decisions to favor safety over accuracy, as well as expectations regarding uncertainty in aircraft trajectory. In 2 experiments, controllers indicated whether they would intervene to ensure separation between pairs of aircraft. The model closely predicted the probability of controller intervention across the geometry of problems and as a function of controller experience. When controller safety margins were manipulated via task instructions, the parameters of the model changed in the predicted direction. The strength of the model over existing and alternative models is that it better captures the uncertainty and decision biases involved in the process of conflict detection.

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for providing a quantitative measure of resilience in the presence of multiple related disaster events. It extends the concepts of the resilience triangle and predicted disaster resilience by considering the tradeoffs between multiple criteria for each individual sub-event, as well as for an entire multi-event situation. The focus of the research is on sudden-onset disasters, and on the initial impact of each sub-event as well as the amount of time available to work towards recovery of the system before the next sub-event occurs. A mathematical model is developed for the new resilience measure, along with an approach for graphically representing the relationships between the different criteria. An example is then provided of using the new approach to compare the relative resilience of different scenarios under a representative multi-event disaster situation. The results demonstrate that characterizing multi-event resilience analytically can ultimately provide a great depth of information and thus support better disaster planning and mitigation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Santos2004,
abstract = {Interdependency analysis in the context of this article is a process of assessing and managing risks inherent in a system of interconnected entities (e.g., infrastructures or industry sectors). Invoking the principles of input-output (I-O) and decomposition analysis, the article offers a framework for describing how terrorism-induced perturbations can propagate due to interconnectedness. Data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce is utilized to present applications to serve as test beds for the proposed framework. Specifically, a case study estimating the economic impact of airline demand perturbations to national-level U.S. sectors is made possible using I-O matrices. A ranking of the affected sectors according to their vulnerability to perturbations originating from a primary sector (e.g., air transportation) can serve as important input to risk management. For example, limited resources can be prioritized for the "top-n" sectors that are perceived to suffer the greatest economic losses due to terrorism. In addition, regional decomposition via location quotients enables the analysis of local-level terrorism events. The Regional I-O Multiplier System II (RIMS II) Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency responsible for releasing the regional multipliers for various geographical resolutions (economic areas, states, and counties). A regional-level case study demonstrates a process of estimating the economic impact of transportation-related scenarios on industry sectors within Economic Area 010 (the New York metropolitan region and vicinities).},

electrochemical migration in conductor-insulator structures, which may
result in failures and reliability problems in microcircuits. The
classical model of electrochemical migration has been well known for
several decades. This process is a transport of metal ions between two
metallization stripes under bias through a continuous aqueous
electrolyte. Due to the electrodeposition at the cathode, dendrites and
dendrite-like deposits are formed. Ultimately, such a deposit can lead
to a short circuit in the device and can clause catastrophic failure. A
few anomalous and newly discovered phenomena have initiated us to
perform some revisions and to add supplementary models to the
conventional one. A theoretical review based on practical results is
given about the most important possible processes. Material design

@article{Maryline2006,
abstract = {In this article we propose a theoretical discussion around the resilience concept and practice. Based upon a safety managerial trend aiming to diffuse safety culture through training within a pharmaceutical industry, analysis are initiated to define how organizational resilience (attached to safety culture) interweaves with risk factors and can be developed through training. Classical safety management aims at developing various systems, technical as well as organizational, to prevent and protect against dangers. Training, in this case, is a matter of risk assessment development. We suggest a new perspective stemming from human management. Its axis is to identify the frame of psychological resilience and to consider how it can be sustained. Psychological resilience appears to be a three-dimensional phenomenon less linked to risk assessment than to cultural structuralism and systemic adaptation. Along with the discussion, the question of training towards psychological resilience is discussed as well. It appears that resilience is questioned by uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity, and framed by structural, symbolic and relational systems; risk factors awareness, prudence and justice standards, along with systemic adaptation, altogether can sustain flexible and adaptative responses.},

Low operational availability of fighter aircrafts can cause many problems and ROKA (Republic of Korea Airforce) needs proper strategies to improve the current practice of reliability management by accurately forecasting both MTBF (mean time between failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair). In this paper, we develop a random effects model to forecast both MTBF and MTTR of installed modules of fighter aircrafts based on their characteristics and operational conditions. Advantage of using such a random effects model is the ability of accommodating not only the individual characteristics of each module and operational conditions but also the uncertainty caused by random error that cannot be explained by them. Our study is expected to contribute to ROKA in improving operational availability of fighter aircrafts and establishing effective logistics management.},

Systematic and sustained improvement in clinical quality in particular has a more brief and less heroic trajectory. Over the past fifty years, a variety of approaches have been tried, with only limited success. More recently, some health care organizations began to adopt the lessons of high-reliability science, which studies organizations such as those in the commercial aviation industry, which manage great hazard extremely well. We review the evolution of quality improvement in US health care and propose a framework that hospitals and other organizations can use to move toward high reliability.},

abstract = {The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction reported that the 2011 natural disasters, including the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, resulted in {\$}366 billion in direct damages and 29,782 fatalities worldwide. Storms and floods accounted for up to 70{\%} of the 302 natural disasters worldwide in 2011, with earthquakes producing the greatest number of fatalities. Average annual losses in the United States amount to about {\$}55 billion. Enhancing community and system resilience could lead to massive savings through risk reduction and expeditious recovery. The rational management of such reduction and recovery is facilitated by an appropriate definition of resilience and associated metrics. In this article, a resilience definition is provided that meets a set of requirements with clear relationships to the metrics of the relevant abstract notions of reliability and risk. Those metrics also meet logically consistent requirements drawn from measure theory, and provide a sound basis for the development of effective decision-making tools for multihazard environments. Improving the resiliency of a system to meet target levels requires the examination of system enhancement alternatives in economic terms, within a decision-making framework. Relevant decision analysis methods would typically require the examination of resilience based on its valuation by society at large. The article provides methods for valuation and benefit-cost analysis based on concepts from risk analysis and management.},

abstract = {Model uncertainty has the potential to change importantly how monetary policy should be conducted, making it an issue that central banks cannot ignore. In this paper, I use a standard new Keynesian business cycle model to analyze the behavior of a central bank that conducts policy with discretion while fearing that its model is misspecified. I begin by showing how to solve linear-quadratic robust Markov-perfect Stackelberg problems where the leader fears that private agents form expectations using the misspecified model. Next, I exploit the connection between robust control and uncertainty aversion to present and interpret my results in terms of the distorted beliefs held by the central bank, households, and firms. My main results are as follows. First, the central bank's pessimism leads it to forecast future outcomes using an expectations operator that, relative to rational expectations, assigns greater probability to extreme inflation and consumption outcomes. Second, the central bank's skepticism about its model causes it to move forcefully to stabilize inflation following shocks. Finally, even in the absence of misspecification, policy loss can be improved if the central bank implements a robust policy.},

abstract = {The control of quantum dynamics via specially tailored laser pulses is a long-standing goal in physics and chemistry. Partly, this dream has come true, as sophisticated pulse shaping experiments allow to coherently control product ratios of chemical reactions. The theoretical design of the laser pulse to transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an introduction to QOCT. It shows how the control equations defining such an optimal pulse follow from the variation of a properly defined functional. We explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms are then applied to simple quantum systems and the obtained pulses are analyzed. Besides the traditional final-time control methods, the tutorial also presents an algorithm and an example to handle time-dependent control targets.},

abstract = {Most studies on multi-state series-parallel systems focus on the static type of system architecture. However, it is insufficient to model many complex industrial systems having several operation phases and each requires a subset of the subsystems combined together to perform certain tasks. To bridge this gap, this study takes into account this type of dynamic behavior in the multi-state series-parallel system and proposes an analytical approach to calculate the system availability and the operation cost. In this approach, Markov process is used to model the dynamics of system phase changing and component state changing, Markov reward model is used to calculate the operation cost associated with the dynamics, and universal generating function (UGF) is used to build system availability function from the system phase model and the component models. Based upon these models, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total system cost with the constraint that system availability is greater than a desired level. The genetic algorithm is then applied to solve the optimization problem. The proposed modeling and solution procedures are illustrated on a system design problem modified from a real-world maritime oil transportation system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions generated by our approach honour those restrictions. By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By considering precedence constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.

abstract = {Although electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, charge and discharge faster than batteries, they are still limited by low energy densities and slow rate capabilities. We used a standard LightScribe DVD optical drive to do the direct laser reduction of graphite oxide films to graphene. The produced films are mechanically robust, show high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram), and can thus be used directly as EC electrodes without the need for binders or current collectors, as is the case for conventional ECs. Devices made with these electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes while maintaining the high power density and excellent cycle stability of ECs. Moreover, these ECs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes under high mechanical stress and thus hold promise for high-power, flexible electronics.},

In particular, we prove a variant of the universality results of Soshnikov for the largest eigenvalues, assuming moment conditions rather than symmetry conditions. The main new technical observation is that there is a significant bias in the Cauchy interlacing law near the edge of the spectrum which allows one to continue ensuring the delocalization of eigenvectors.},

They are mainly an agricultural and cattle herding society whose subsistence relies on the slash-and-burn farming agriculture (hatsake) and the burning of cacti which are given as fodder to the livestock (ororaketa). These activities generate ecological pressure on the surrounding dry forest and socioeconomic risks related to the lack of sustainability of these practices in the long run. In this paper we address the notion of sustainability and confront it with Tandroy's current productive and economic system. By means of the viability theory, we characterize the actions and scenarios that are compatible with a sustainable use of the forest in the region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an evolutionary optimization approach that can be readily applied to solve stochastic network interdiction problems (SNIP). The network interdiction problem solved considers the minimization of the cost associated with an interdiction strategy such that the maximum flow that can be transmitted between a source node and a sink node for a fixed network design is greater than or equal to a given reliability requirement. Furthermore, the model assumes that the nominal capacity of each network link and the cost associated with their interdiction can change from link to link and that such interdiction has a probability of being successful. This version of the SNIP is for the first time modeled as a capacitated network reliability problem allowing for the implementation of computation and solution techniques previously unavailable. The solution process is based on an evolutionary algorithm that implements: (1) Monte-Carlo simulation, to generate potential network interdiction strategies, (2) capacitated network reliability techniques to analyze strategies' source-sink flow reliability and, (3) an evolutionary optimization technique to define, in probabilistic terms, how likely a link is to appear in the final interdiction strategy. Examples for different sizes of networks are used throughout the paper to illustrate the approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The manufacturer performs a newsvendor analysis with the possible result of significant expected overage and underage costs. If the decision can be delayed, the expected overage and underage costs can be reduced. We model the effects of a delay of the final purchase under various scenarios of remaining demand. We contrast the manufacturing benefits with the costs incurred by the supplier and show that the supplier, who benefits greatly from the end-of-life buy, likely will require an incentive to enact a delay. Our results provide an insight to the observation of increasing numbers of end-of-life buys and provides a framework for analysis as manufacturers strive to cope with the issue. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of human error has matured and been applied over the past 50 years by human factors engineers, whereas the resilience engineering paradigm is relatively new. METHOD: Fundamental ideas and examples of human factors applications of each approach are presented and contrasted. RESULTS: Probabilistic risk analysis provides mathematical rigor in generalizing on past error events to identify system vulnerabilities, but prediction is problematical because (a) error definition is arbitrary, and thus it is difficult to infer valid probabilities of human error to input to quantitative models, and (b) future accident conditions are likely to be quite different from those of past accidents. The new resilience engineering paradigm, in contrast, is oriented toward organizational process and is concerned with anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for graceful recovery from future events. CONCLUSION: Resilience engineering complements traditional error analysis but has yet to provide useful quantification and operational methods. APPLICATION: A best safety strategy is to use both approaches.},

abstract = {A system of independent components is defended by a strategic defender and attacked by a strategic attacker. The reliability of each component depends on how strongly it is defended and attacked, and on the intensity of the contest. In a series system, the attacker benefits from a substitution effect since attacker benefits flow from attacking any of the components, while the defender needs to defend all components. Even for a series system, when the attacker is sufficiently disadvantaged with high attack inefficiencies, and the intensity of the contest is sufficiently high, the defender earns maximum utility and the attacker earns zero utility. The results for the defender (attacker) in a parallel system are equivalent to the results for the attacker (defender) in a series system. Hence, the defender benefits from the substitution effect in parallel systems. With budget constraints the ratio of the investments for each component, and the contest success function for each component, are the same as without budget constraints when replacing the system values for the defender and attacker with their respective budget constraints. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent natural and man-made catastrophes, such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant, flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Haiti earthquake, and the mortgage derivatives crisis, have renewed interest in the concept of resilience, especially as it relates to complex systems vulnerable to multiple or cascading failures. Although the meaning of resilience is contested in different contexts, in general resilience is understood to mean the capacity to adapt to changing conditions without catastrophic loss of form or function. In the context of engineering systems, this has sometimes been interpreted as the probability that system conditions might exceed an irrevocable tipping point. However, we argue that this approach improperly conflates resilience and risk perspectives by expressing resilience exclusively in risk terms. In contrast, we describe resilience as an emergent property of what an engineering system does, rather than a static property the system has. Therefore, resilience cannot be measured at the systems scale solely from examination of component parts. Instead, resilience is better understood as the outcome of a recursive process that includes: sensing, anticipation, learning, and adaptation. In this approach, resilience analysis can be understood as differentiable from, but complementary to, risk analysis, with important implications for the adaptive management of complex, coupled engineering systems. Management of the 2011 flooding in the Mississippi River Basin is discussed as an example of the successes and challenges of resilience-based management of complex natural systems that have been extensively altered by engineered structures.},

abstract = {A "proliferator" seeks to complete a first small batch of fission weapons as quickly as possible, whereas an "interdictor" wishes to delay that completion for as long as possible. We develop and solve a max-min model that identifies resource-limited interdiction actions that maximally delay completion time of the proliferator's weapons project, given that the proliferator will observe any such actions and adjust his plans to minimize that time. The model incorporates a detailed project-management (critical path method) submodel, and standard optimization software solves the model in a few minutes on a personal computer. We exploit off-the-shelf project-management software to manage a database, control the optimization, and display results. Using a range of levels for interdiction effort, we analyze a published case study that models three alternate uranium-enrichment technologies. The task of "cascade loading" appears in all technologies and turns out to be an inherent fragility for the proliferator at all levels of interdiction effort. Such insights enable policy makers to quantify the effects of interdiction options at their disposal, be they diplomatic, economic, or military. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

Specifically, the five brittle and ductile fracture modes are studied, from three well characterized steels (a mild steel, a low-alloy steel and a 32 wt{\%} Mn-steel) where the salient microstructural dimensions contributing to the final fracture morphology have been measured. Resulting plots of the mean angular deviation, and Richardson (fractal) plots of the lineal roughness, as a function of the measuring step size, are interpreted with the aid of computer-simulated fracture-surface profiles with known characteristics. It is found that the ranges of resolution, over which the fractal dimension is constant, correspond to the pertinent metallurgical dimensions on the fracture surface, and thus can be related to microstructural size-scales.},

abstract = {Model updating procedures are applied in order to improve the matching between experimental data and corresponding model output. The updated, i.e. improved, finite element (FE) model can be used for more reliable predictions of the structural performance in the target mechanical environment. The discrepancies between the output of the FE-model and the results of tests are due to the uncertainties that are involved in the modeling process. These uncertainties concern the structural parameters, measurement errors, the incompleteness of the test data and also the FE-model itself. The latter type of uncertainties is often referred to as model uncertainties and is caused by simplifications of the real structure that are made in order to reduce the complexity of reality. Several approaches have been proposed for taking model uncertainties into consideration, where the focus of this manuscript will be set on the updating procedure within the Bayesian statistical framework. A numerical example involving different degrees of nonlinearity will be used for demonstrating how this type of uncertainty is considered within the Bayesian updating procedure.},

abstract = {To assess the association between the incidence of cutaneous melanoma; intermittent, occupational and total sun exposure; and history of sunburn at different ages, we conducted a systematic review using results of all published case-control studies which have assessed incident melanoma, sun exposure and sunburn. Twenty-nine studies contributed data on sun exposure and 21 on sunburn. Overall, there was a significant positive association (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71) for intermittent exposure, a significantly reduced risk for heavy occupational exposure (OR = 0.86) and a small, marginally significant excess risk for total exposure (OR = 1.18). There was a significantly increased risk with sunburn at all ages or in adult life (OR = 1.91) and similarly elevated relative risks for sunburn in adolescence (OR = 1.73) and in childhood (OR = 1.95). There was significant heterogeneity with all of these estimates except that of all ages or adult sunburn. These results show the specificity of the positive association between melanoma risk and intermittent sun exposure, in contrast to a reduced risk with high levels of occupational exposure. The association with sunburn also is likely to reflect intermittent exposure; the results do not suggest any strong relationship to age at sunburn. These associations are similar to those reported for basal cell skin cancer but different from those reported for squamous cell cancer. The mechanisms by which intermittent exposure increases risk, while other patterns of exposure do not, remain to be elucidated.},

abstract = {The increasing interest in resilience engineering (RE) has led to a demand for frameworks that undertake safety assessments from such a standpoint. However, the few existing frameworks have drawbacks, such as not analyzing the sources of resilience (SRs) and the sources of brittleness (SBs) side-by-side. Moreover, they limit themselves to investigating resilience in pre-determined units of analysis (e.g., teams), neglecting the fact that resilience might be in any element of a socio-technical system. This article introduces a framework for identifying and analyzing SRs and SBs jointly, which do not constrain the identification process to any specific unit of analysis within the investigated system. The sources should be identified and analyzed across five categories: the opposite SR or SB; the risk from the SB; the effectiveness of the SR; those originating from either internal processes or the external environment; those arising from formal or informal practices. A case study of two air taxi carriers illustrates the application of the framework. Relevance to industry: Resilience engineering (RE) is an emerging safety management paradigm concerned with normal work, rather than emphasizing learning from incidents. The proposed framework allows the identification and analysis of the most salient sources of resilience and brittleness. It can be applied for investigating resilience at any unit of analysis within a socio-technical system, supporting the identification of strengths and weaknesses from the RE perspective. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Reliability function [R(t) = P(T ? t)] (where T is the lifetime or failure time, and P is the probability) serves as the definition of reliability very successfully in the sense that (i) it acts as an excellent pedagogical model; (ii) its fundamental concept, although often extended extensively, still holds in complex real-world reliability analysis. In contrast with reliability analysis, there is not a commonly accepted survivability function that assumes a similar role as the reliability function does in reliability analysis. In this article, I first analyze the challenges of defining such a survivability function that is similar to reliability function, and then argue that by synthesizing the existing definitions developed by leading scholars of survivability research [notably, Ellison et al. (1997), T1A1 group (ANSI T1A1.2, 2001), Knight (2003), Liu {\&}amp;amp; Trivedi (2004), ?ResiliNets Project? (ReSterbenz {\&}amp;amp; Hutchinson et al. 2009)], a unified definition for reliability and survivability in the form of a 4-tuple: Survivability = [Resistance, Resilience, Persistence, Failure Counter], with the notion that resistance is equivalent to traditional reliability, is meaningful. Although the 4-tuple definition is much more complex than the reliability function, I argue that it possesses promising potential to become a survivability definition with the two similar properties demonstrated by the traditional reliability function. My arguments are based on two lines of developments: (i) The first three elements of the 4-tuple capture critical aspects of survivability and each of them possesses rigorously defined mathematical models. These models, developed in a series of our previous studies (Ma {\&}amp;amp; Krings 2008a-d, Ma 2008, 2009a-c), when integrated together, form a modeling architecture for performing many real-world reliability and survivability analyses. This contribution from the new 4-tuple definition corresponds to the second property of the traditional reliabil-
-
ity function. (ii) The 4-tuple definition is also inspired by two biological theories: the handicap principle that governs the honesty (reliability) of animal communication, and the stability theory of ecological systems. Both theories are examples of nature's versions of `reliability' and `survivability'. How nature evolves both reliable and survivable (super reliable) features should be inspirational to the study of engineering reliability and survivability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Systemic issues can adversely affect the diagnostic process. Many system-related barriers can be masked by 'resilient' actions of frontline providers (ie, actions supporting the safe delivery of care in the presence of pressures that the system cannot readily adapt to). We explored system barriers and resilient actions of primary care providers (PCPs) in the diagnostic evaluation of cancer., METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of interviews of PCPs involved in diagnostic evaluation of 29 lung and colorectal cancer cases. Cases covered a range of diagnostic timeliness and were analysed to identify barriers for rapid diagnostic evaluation, and PCPs' actions involving elements of resilience addressing those barriers. We rated these actions according to whether they were usual or extraordinary for typical PCP work., RESULTS: Resilient actions and associated barriers were found in 59{\%} of the cases, in all ranges of timeliness, with 40{\%} involving actions rated as beyond typical. Most of the barriers were related to access to specialty services and coordination with patients. Many of the resilient actions involved using additional communication channels to solicit cooperation from other participants in the diagnostic process., DISCUSSION: Diagnostic evaluation of cancer involves several resilient actions by PCPs targeted at system deficiencies. PCPs' actions can sometimes mitigate system barriers to diagnosis, and thereby impact the sensitivity of 'downstream' measures (eg, delays) in detecting barriers. While resilient actions might enable providers to mitigate system deficiencies in the short run, they can be resource intensive and potentially unsustainable. They complement, rather than substitute for, structural remedies to improve system performance. Measures to detect and fix system performance issues targeted by these resilient actions could facilitate diagnostic safety.},

abstract = {Evaluating a fractal curve's "approximate length" by walking a compass defines a "compass exponent." Long ago, I showed that for a self-similar curve (e.g., a model of coastline), the compass exponent coincides with all the other forms of the fractal dimension, e.g., the similarity, box or mass dimensions. Now walk a compass along a self-affine curve, such as a scalar Brownian record B(t). It will be shown that a full description in terms of fractal dimension is complex. Each version of dimension has a local and a global value, separated by a crossover. First finding: the basic methods of evaluating the global fractal dimension yield 1: globally, a self-affine fractal behaves as it if were not fractal. Second finding: the box and mass dimensions are 1.5, but the compass dimension is D = 2. More generally, for a fractional Bownian record BH(t), (e.g., a model of vertical cuts of relief), the global fractal dimensions are 1, several local fractal dimensions are 2-H, and the compass dimension is 1/H. This 1/H is the fractal dimension of a self-similar fractal trail, whose definition was already implicit in the definition of the record of BH(t).},

abstract = {Through 3 broad and interconnected streams of thought, resilience thinking has influenced the science of ecology and natural resource management by generating new multidisciplinary approaches to environmental problem solving. Resilience science, adaptive management (AM), and ecological policy design (EPD) contributed to an internationally unified paradigm built around the realization that change is inevitable and that science and management must approach the world with this assumption, rather than one of stability. Resilience thinking treats actions as experiments to be learned from, rather than intellectual propositions to be defended or mistakes to be ignored. It asks what is novel and innovative and strives to capture the overall behavior of a system, rather than seeking static, precise outcomes from discrete action steps. Understanding the foundations of resilience thinking is an important building block for developing more holistic and adaptive approaches to conservation. We conducted a comprehensive review of the history of resilience thinking because resilience thinking provides a working context upon which more effective, synergistic, and systems-based conservation action can be taken in light of rapid and unpredictable change. Together, resilience science, AM, and EPD bridge the gaps between systems analysis, ecology, and resource management to provide an interdisciplinary approach to solving wicked problems.

abstract = {New technology is making fundamental changes in the etiology of accidents and is creating a need for changes in the explanatory mechanisms used. We need better and less subjective understanding of why accidents occur and how to prevent future ones. The most effective models will go beyond assigning blame and instead help engineers to learn as much as possible about all the factors involved, including those related to social and organizational structures. This paper presents a new accident model founded on basic systems theory concepts. The use of such a model provides a theoretical foundation for the introduction of unique new types of accident analysis, hazard analysis, accident prevention strategies including new approaches to designing for safety, risk assessment techniques, and approaches to designing performance monitoring and safety metrics. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The seismic resilience of a system can be achieved by reducing its probability of failure during an earthquake, as well as reducing the consequences from such failures and the time to recovery. Within the perspective of this framework, this paper explores the physical resilience of facilities. Quantification of resilience is first approached from the broader societal context, from which the engineering sub-problem is formulated as an important building block of the integrated tool ultimately needed. Quantification of physical resilience for facilities relates the probability of exceeding floor accelerations and inter-story drifts within a specified limit space, for the structural and non-structural performance. Non- linear structural responses are considered, as well as the impact of retrofit or repair. Impact on time to recovery is considered in all cases. The proposed framework makes it possible to relate probability functions, fragilities, and resilience in a single integrated approach, and to further develop general tools to quantify resilience.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the concept of disaster resilience through the de- velopment and application of quantitative measures. As the idea of building disaster-resilient communities gains acceptance, new methods are needed that go beyond estimating monetary losses and that address the complex, multiple dimensions of resilience. These dimensions include technical, organizational, social, and economic facets. This paper first proposes resilience measures that relate expected losses in future disasters to a community’s seismic per- formance objectives. It then demonstrates these measures in a case study of the Memphis, Tennessee, water delivery system. An existing earthquake loss estimation model provides a starting point for quantifying resilience. The analysis compares two seismic retrofit strategies and finds that only one im- proves community resilience over the status quo. However, it does not raise resilience to an adequate degree. The exercise demonstrates that the resilience framework can be valuable for guiding mitigation and preparedness efforts. However, to fully implement the concept, new research on resilience is needed that goes beyond loss estimation modeling.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The common view is that major transitions come about through breakthroughs of technological discontinuities. This article proposes gradual and stepwise reconfiguration as an alternative transition pathway. In it, new elements are adopted in the existing socio-technical regime to help solve particular problems. But as more is learned and circumstances change, these elements may trigger further changes in technology, user practice, infrastructure, and policies, eventually altering the basic architecture of the regime. These notions are integrated in a multi-level perspective on transitions and system changes. The resulting reconfiguration perspective is illustrated with a historical case study of the transition from traditional factories to mass production in America (1850-1930). The analysis shows that mass production was the last step in a much longer reconfiguration process involving cumulative changes in machine tools, building materials, materials handling technologies, power generation, and power-distribution technologies. The reconfiguration perspective has wider relevance for other systems that function through the interplay of multiple technologies, e.g., agriculture, retailing, and hospitals. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurement and maximization of network resilience that accounts for both in the context of intermodal freight transport are addressed herein. That is, the problem of measuring a networks maximum resilience level and simultaneously determining the optimal set of preparedness and recovery actions necessary to achieve this level under budget and level-of-service constraints is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. An exact methodology, employing the integer L-shaped method and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed for its solution. Optimal allocation of a limited budget between preparedness and recovery activities is explored on an illustrative problem instance involving a network abstraction of a United States rail-based intermodal container network. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In recent years, socio-technical transitions literature has gained importance in addressing long-term, transformative change in various industries. In order to account for the inertia and path-dependency experienced in these sectors, the concept of the socio-technical regime has been formulated. Socio-technical regimes denote the paradigmatic core of a sector, which results from the co-evolution of institutions and technologies over time. Despite its widespread acceptance, the regime concept has repeatedly been criticized for lacking a clear operationalization. As a consequence, empirical applications tend to depict regimes as too 'monolithic' and 'homogenous', not adequately considering persistent institutional tensions and contradictions. These are however crucial for assessing transition dynamics. In this paper, we revisit two concepts from institutional theory that enable an explicit identification of socio-technical regimes and more generally a specification of the 'semi-coherence' of socio-technical systems. First, we will show that 'levels of structuration' can be conceptualized as degrees of institutionalization, thereby treating institutionalization as a variable with different effects on actors, the stability of the system and thus the potential for change. Secondly, we draw on the institutional logics approach to characterize the content of various structural elements present in a system and to trace conflicts and contradictions between them. We illustrate this approach with an empirical in-depth analysis of the transformation of the Australian urban water sector since the 1970ies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Incident data about disruptions to the electric power grid provide useful information that can be used as inputs into risk management policies in the energy sector for disruptions from a variety of origins, including terrorist attacks. This article uses data from the Disturbance Analysis Working Group (DAWG) database, which is maintained by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), to look at incidents over time in the United States and Canada for the period 1990-2004. Negative binomial regression, logistic regression, and weighted least squares regression are used to gain a better understanding of how these disturbances varied over time and by season during this period, and to analyze how characteristics such as number of customers lost and outage duration are related to different characteristics of the outages. The results of the models can be used as inputs to construct various scenarios to estimate potential outcomes of electric power outages, encompassing the risks, consequences, and costs of such outages.},

abstract = {The creation of an innovation niche depends on the interaction of three mechanisms involving: converging expectations, networking among the innovation actors, and learning about the novelty through efficient knowledge creation and diffusion. Such mechanisms define the key characteristics of a network of firms (i.e. the innovation niche), and the interaction among them guides the development and diffusion of a new technology. In this paper, we propose an agent-based model to investigate the dynamics characterising such interactions and the role that policy intervention can have in governing the niche development process. Specifically, we consider and assess the impact of two policy actions: (1) increasing actors' expectations towards the new technology by means of information spreading and (2) providing subsidies aimed at stimulating technological switch. Our results confirm the importance of policy intervention and show the dominance of information spreading activities over subsidies. The former policy action, in fact, preserves a broad consensus around the new technology, a fact which turned out to be fundamental in order to promote efficient knowledge diffusion and the effective use of individual and network resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The authors describe facets of their recent and ongoing research within the field of engineering systems to develop constructs and methods for architecting enterprises engaged in system-of-systems (SoS) engineering,. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a framework for characterizing, designing, and evaluating SoS enterprise architectures throughout the system lifespan as various forces result in entering/exiting of constituent systems, changing environment, and shifting enterprise profile. The nature of systems-of-systems demands constructs for multi-dimensional architectural descriptions, as well as methods for design and evaluation that employ dynamic approaches. In this paper, two important elements in an emerging framework are described, including a holistic enterprise architecting framework and an epoch-based analysis method for examining possible futures of the SoS enterprise.},

@article{Chan2012,
abstract = {The ability to be resilient, or the ability to remain in-control in the face of surprising challenge events, is relevant to various domains such as control theory, critical infrastructure, disaster response, ecosystems and business continuity. Evidence from studying specific fields of practice that are highly resilient has identified critical properties of human complex adaptive systems. Human systems are made up of multiple units or centers of adaptive behavior that exhibit control strategies to mitigate the potential for brittleness relative to the potential for surprise that carry high consequences. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nOne key concept that has emerged from these studies is Margin of Maneuver (Woods and Branlat, 2010): a cushion of potential actions and additional resources that allows the system to continue functioning despite unexpected demands. When Margin of Maneuver is lost, so is the ability to control the system when unexpected shocks occur – in other words, if Margin of Maneuver is too low a system will not be able to remain in-control in the future should new challenge events occur. As a result, the concept Margin of Maneuver provides the basis to develop resilient control systems. This thesis takes the concept of Margin of Maneuver and develops a notation for the specific parameters and requirements that define how a resilient control system functions.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe concept of Margin of Maneuver provides a means to assess the brittleness of systems a key goal of the Resilience Engineering research agenda (Woods, 2006). The concept of Margin of Maneuver also provides a focus for how organizations learn about and monitor $\backslash$r$\backslash$ntheir resilience/brittleness – about how the organization is able to bring extra adaptive capacity to bear before in-control strategies reach a point of breakdown. Finally, the concept of Margin of Maneuver provides a basis for identifying polycentric governance policies as one unit’s struggle to sustain its margin may undermine the ability of other units to hold sufficient margin to handle potential challenge events (Stephens et al., 2011). This thesis advances models of Margin of Maneuver by specifying a control process that can be implemented so that units or center of adaptive behavior will be able to maintain an appropriate Margin of Maneuver as situations change.},

@article{Droguett2008,
abstract = {A simple and useful characterization of many predictive models is in terms of model structure and model parameters. Accordingly, uncertainties in model predictions arise from uncertainties in the values assumed by the model parameters (parameter uncertainty) and the uncertainties and errors associated with the structure of the model (model uncertainty). When assessing uncertainty one is interested in identifying, at some level of confidence, the range of possible and then probable values of the unknown of interest. All sources of uncertainty and variability need to be considered. Although parameter uncertainty assessment has been extensively discussed in the literature, model uncertainty is a relatively new topic of discussion by the scientific community, despite being often the major contributor to the overall uncertainty. This article describes a Bayesian methodology for the assessment of model uncertainties, where models are treated as sources of information on the unknown of interest. The general framework is then specialized for the case where models provide point estimates about a single-valued unknown, and where information about models are available in form of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous performance data (pairs of experimental observations and model predictions). Several example applications for physical models used in fire risk analysis are also provided.},

We compute the structural capacity of the wind towers by means of nonlinear static structural analysis for three wind hazard levels; then, the limit state dependent and life-cycle costs for the wind park are calculated based on the proposed model. The wind load for each wind hazard level is based on actual collected data and is generated probabilistically. Application of the proposed life-cycle cost analysis model is tested for a wind park with known characteristics (number and location of wind towers, wind potential, and so on).},

@article{Carmeli2013,
abstract = {Despite growing research interest in both top management team (TMT) processes and resilience in organizations, these two streams of research have remained largely separate, let alone fully developed. In this study, we examine whether and why relational connections marked by connectivity facilitate strategic decision comprehensiveness, and cultivate two forms of TMT resilience that capture both efficacious beliefs and adaptive capacity. Based on a sample of 74 TMTs, the findings of this study indicate that (1) connectivity is positively related to strategic decision comprehensiveness, (2) strategic decision comprehensiveness is positively associated with both forms of TMT resilience, and (3) connectivity is indirectly, through strategic decision comprehensiveness, related to both TMT resilience-efficacious beliefs and TMT resilience-adaptive capacity. These findings have direct implications for research on TMTs, decision-making processes, and resilience by specifying the ways in which relational connections help build capacities in senior executive teams. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Aleksic2014,
abstract = {There are many factors that can make an organization and its business unsafe and endanger its sustainable development. Exposure of an organization to existing risks may vary and it can be studied from different perspectives, but undoubtedly increased vulnerability of an organization can lead to disaster. This paper investigates the general vulnerability of an organization and proposes a model for its assessment. The process approach has been employed to define the model of an organization, as well as the fuzzy approach for mathematical modeling of uncertainties. An assessed value of organization vulnerability is obtained by using linguistic expressions which are close to human thinking. The mathematical model of organization vulnerability is solved through fuzzy sets with input data defined by a management team. The model for vulnerability assessment is verified through an illustrative example. The obtained results represent an input for future research which should include a good benchmark base for the tested organizations and their continuous improvement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We contribute to the debate over the contemporary relevance of the Austrian Business Cycle theory (ABC) by making three theoretical developments. First, we claim that the heterogeneous nature of entrepreneurship is the best means to respond to a Rational Expectations (RE) critique. If entrepreneurs are different then the "cluster of errors" are not made by everyone, just those on the margin. And if the marginal entrepreneurs are systematically different from the population as a whole, we avoid the implication of widespread irrationality, even though credit expansion will affect real variables. Second, we argue that the size of the monetary footprint is a more telling signal than the market rate of interest, and will not necessarily be revealed by measured inflation. Therefore attention to the official interest rate or Consumer Price Index is misleading, and an inappropriate way to assess applicability. And third, the main harm from loose monetary policy is not that it encourages entrepreneurs to behave more recklessly with capital, but that it encourages precisely the people who can't afford capital at the market rate to borrow, and makes them the marginal trader. This suggests that adverse selection is a more important issue than moral hazard. We acknowledge that empirical work is required to verify these claims, and suggest how this might be undertaken.},

The injection effects of his business cycle theory provided an alternative basis for his prescription. In the 1970s Hayek switched to endorsing price-level stabilitization. On doing so he was logically compelled to repudiate his business cycle theory.},

abstract = {This article presents the design, construction, and test results of a linear ion trap, fabricated using digital light processing (DLP), which is a low-cost 3D layer-based manufacturing technique. The ion trap was incorporated into a portable mass spectrometer system and experimental mass spectrum was obtained for methamphetamine (m/z 182), cocaine (m/z 304), and rhodamine B (m/z 443), with a maximum observed resolution (FWHM) of 260. For rhodamine B, tandem MS capability is also demonstrated. The mass range (and resolution at higher m/z) of the instrument is also demonstrated by spectrum obtained from Ultramark (m/z 1621). The spectra obtained for the DLP trap occur at a considerably lower rf voltage than a rectilinear ion trap of similar size, which is a consequence of the hyperbolic electrode geometry and, hence, smaller r(0) in the DLP case. High mass range with low voltage operation is especially important with regard to 'in the field' applications requiring low power consumption for extended periods of operation.},

abstract = {Custom orthopedic implants may be generated using free-form fabrication methods (FFF) such as electron beam melting (EBM). EBM FFF may be used to make solid metal implants whose surface is often polished using CNC machining and porous scaffolds that are usually left unpolished. We assessed the in vitro biocompatibility of EBM titanium-6 aluminum-4 vanadium (Ti6Al4V) structures by comparing the cellular response to solid polished, solid unpolished, and porous EBM discs to the cellular response to discs made of commercially produced Ti6Al4V. The discs were seeded with 20,000 human adipose-derived adult stem cells (hASCs) and assessed for cell viability, proliferation, and release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Cell viability was assessed with Live/Dead staining 8 days after seeding. Cell proliferation was assessed using alamarBlue assays at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7. The hASCs were alive on all discs after 8 days. Cellular proliferation on porous EBM discs was increased at days 2, 3, and 7 compared to discs made of commercial Ti6Al4V. Cellular proliferation on porous EBM discs was also increased compared to solid polished and unpolished EBM discs. IL-6 and IL-8 releases at day 7 were lower for porous EBM discs than for other discs. Solid polished, unpolished, and porous EBM Ti6Al4V discs exhibited an acceptable biocompatibility profile compared to solid Ti6Al4V discs from a commercial source. EBM FFF may be considered as an option for the fabrication of custom orthopedic implants.},

abstract = {Purpose –To investigate the influencing rule of the standoff distance variations between the nozzle outlet and the powder deposition point on forming dimensional accuracy, the thin-wall metal parts were fabricated using three different standoff distances by experiments. Design/methodology/approach –The thin-wall parts were built with three different standoff distances: 1mm more than the powder focus length, equal to the powder focus length and 1mm less than the powder focus length. Based on the experimental results, the steady standoff distance can be acquired and the difference between the building height and the ideal height of thin-wall parts can be compensated automatically in several layers by theoretical calculation. Findings –The experimental results show that the top surface unevenness of thin-wall parts can be compensated automatically on the consequent successive layers when the standoff distance is less than the powder focal length from the nozzle outlet to the powder focal point, and the poorer results are obtained when the standoff distance is equal to or more than the powder focal length in the deposition of stainless steel 316L under open-loop control. Practical limitation/implications –The shape of parts affects the self-regulation effect in practical applications, so the self-regulation effect is useful when the single contour of parts is continuous straight faces and the surface of parts is perpendicular to the build platform, and will be useless for parts with holes. Originality/value –According to the requirements under different process conditions in practical applications, we should first find out the relationship between the standoff distance and the building height of single-trace cladding layer, and then use regression algorithm to obtain the stable standoff distance by simple theoretical calculation. The uniform building height, layer thickness and smooth surface can be obtained at the stable standoff distance under open-loop control.},

abstract = {The biomaterials used for central nervous system injury require not only interacting with specific cell adhesion but also specific growth factor receptors to promote nerve regeneration. In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels modified with poly-L-lysine (PLL) and nogo-66 receptor antibody (antiNgR) (HA-PLL/antiNgR) were administered to rats after lateral hemisection of the spinal cord. Anti-neurofilament positive axons were found to extend into the HA-PLL/antiNgR hydrogel at 8 weeks after implantation, which shows significant difference compared with HA-PLL or blank control group. Electron micrographs of implanted hydrogels showed that there were more cells and normal axons with myelin in the HA-PLL/antiNgR implant than that of HA-PLL hydrogel. The antiNgR grafted on HA hydrogels could be detected for 8 weeks after transplantation in vivo. All of these properties may facilitate HA-PLL/antiNgR hydrogels to become a promising scaffold for repairing spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, both two kinds of modified hydrogels (HA-PLL/antiNgR and HA-PLL) showed remarkable advantages in supporting angiogenesis, and simultaneously inhibiting the formation of glial scar.},

Among the most promising INMs being developed are metal, silica, dendrimers, organic-inorganic hybrids, and bioinorganic hybrids. Gold NPs are important in imaging, as drug carriers, and for thermotherapy of biological targets. Gold NPs, nanoshells, nanorods, and nanowires have the extensive potential to be an integral part of our imaging toolbox and useful in the fight against cancer. Metal NP contrast agents enhance magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound results in biomedical applications of in vivo imaging. Hollow and porous INMs have been exploited for drug and gene delivery, diagnostic imaging, and photothermal therapy. Silver NPs show improved antimicrobial activity. Silica NPs have been used in drug delivery and gene therapy. Biomolecular inorganic nanohybrids and nanostructured biomaterials have been exploited for targeted imaging and therapy, drug and gene delivery, and regenerative medicine. Dendrimers find use as drug or gene carriers, contrast agents, and sensors for different metal ions.

abstract = {In this study, a novel porous titanium structure for the purpose of bone in-growth has been designed, manufactured and evaluated. The structure was produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM); a rapid manufacturing process capable of producing highly intricate, functionally graded parts. The technique described utilizes an approach based on a defined regular unit cell to design and produce structures with a large range of both physical and mechanical properties. These properties can be tailored to suit specific requirements; in particular, functionally graded structures with bone in-growth surfaces exhibiting properties comparable to those of human bone have been manufactured. The structures were manufactured and characterized by unit cell size, strand diameter, porosity, and compression strength. They exhibited a porosity (10-95{\%}) dependant compression strength (0.5-350 Mpa) comparable to the typical naturally occurring range. It is also demonstrated that optimized structures have been produced that possesses ideal qualities for bone in-growth applications and that these structures can be applied in the production of orthopedic devices.},

abstract = {Porous NiTi alloy samples were fabricated with 12-36{\%} porosity from equiatomic NiTi alloy powder using laser engineered net shaping (LENS). The effects of processing parameters on density and properties of laser-processed NiTi alloy samples were investigated. It was found that the density increased rapidly with increasing the specific energy input up to 50 J/mm(3). Further increase in the energy input had small effect on density. High cooling rates associated with LENS processing resulted in higher amount of cubic B2 phase, and increased the reverse transformation temperatures of porous NiTi samples due to thermally induced stresses and defects. Transformation temperatures were found to be independent of pore volume, though higher pore volume in the samples decreased the maximum recoverable strain from 6{\%} to 4{\%}. Porous NiTi alloy samples with 12-36{\%} porosity exhibited low Young's modulus between 2 and 18 GPa as well as high compressive strength and recoverable strain. Because of high open pore volume between 36{\%} and 62{\%} of total volume fraction porosity, these porous NiTi alloy samples can potentially accelerate the healing process and improve biological fixation when implanted in vivo. Thus porous NiTi is a promising biomaterial for hard tissue replacements.},

abstract = {Two porous titanium implants with a pore size diameter of 800 and 1200 microm (Ti800 and Ti1200) and an interconnected network were manufactured using rapid prototyping. Their dimensions and structure matched those of the computer assisted design. The porosity of the implants was around 60{\%}. Their compressive strength and Young's modulus were around 80 MPa and 2.7 GPa, respectively. These values are comparable to those of cortical bone. The implants were implanted bilaterally in the femoral epiphysis of 15 New Zealand White rabbits. After 3 and 8 weeks, abundant bone formation was found inside the rapid prototyped porous titanium implants. For the Ti1200 implants, bone ingrowth was (23.9 +/- 3.5){\%} and (10.3 +/- 2.8){\%}, respectively. A significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) was found for bone ingrowth in the Ti1200 between the two delays. The percentage of bone directly apposited on titanium was (35.8 +/- 5.4){\%} and (30.5 +/- 5.0){\%}. No significant difference was found for bone-implant contact between the different time periods and pore sizes. This work demonstrates that manufacturing macroporous titanium implants with controlled shape and porosity using a rapid prototyping method is possible and that this technique is a good candidate for orthopedic and maxillofacial applications.},

abstract = {Porous structures are used in orthopaedics to promote biological fixation between metal implant and host bone. In order to achieve rapid and high volumes of bone ingrowth the structures must be manufactured from a biocompatible material and possess high interconnected porosities, pore sizes between 100 and 700 microm and mechanical strengths that withstand the anticipated biomechanical loads. The challenge is to develop a manufacturing process that can cost effectively produce structures that meet these requirements. The research presented in this paper describes the development of a 'beam overlap' technique for manufacturing porous structures in commercially pure titanium using the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) rapid manufacturing technique. A candidate bone ingrowth structure (71{\%} porosity, 440 microm mean pore diameter and 70 MPa compression strength) was produced and used to manufacture a final shape orthopaedic component. These results suggest that SLM beam overlap is a promising technique for manufacturing final shape functional bone ingrowth materials.},

abstract = {The most successful metal implant materials currently have relatively smooth surfaces on the micron size scale, with most failures occurring after only 10 years. To move beyond this limiting time scale, texturing methods have been developed to modify the metal surface to enhance integration of the implant directly with surrounding bone. A flexible single-step ultrafast-laser texturing process has been developed that results in a surface texture that exhibits micron scale peaks and troughs with superimposed submicron and nano-scale features. The textured titanium samples remain completely hydrophilic with no measurable contact angle even after several weeks in normal atmosphere. An increase in mesenchymal stem cell number is observed over that on an untreated control titanium surface. Extensive formation of cellular bridges by stromal cells between pillars shows the favorable response of differentiated cells to the surface and the promotion of their attachment. Expression of the alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin genes in human bone marrow cells were seen to increase on the textured surface. The development of this single-step method for creating micron, submicron, and nano-scale surface texture directly on metals makes a significant contribution to the goal of improving the integration and life span of joint replacement implants.},

@article{Pattanayak2010,
abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a useful technique for preparing three-dimensional porous bodies with complicated internal structures directly from titanium (Ti) powders without any intermediate processing steps, with the products being expected to be useful as a bone substitute. In this study the necessary SLM processing conditions to obtain a dense product, such as the laser power, scanning speed, and hatching pattern, were investigated using a Ti powder of less than 45$\mu$m particle size. The results show that a fully dense plate thinner than 1.8mm was obtained when the laser power to scanning speed ratio was greater than 0.5 and the hatch spacing was less than the laser diameter, with a 30$\mu$m thick powder layer. Porous Ti metals with structures analogous to human cancellous bone were fabricated and the compressive strength measured. The compressive strength was in the range 35-120MPa when the porosity was in the range 75-55{\%}. Porous Ti metals fabricated by SLM were heat-treated at 1300°C for 1h in an argon gas atmosphere to smooth the surface. Such prepared specimens were subjected to NaOH, HCl, and heat treatment to provide bioactivity. Field emission scanning electron micrographs showed that fine networks of titanium oxide were formed over the whole surface of the porous body. These treated porous bodies formed bone-like apatite on their surfaces in a simulated body fluid within 3days. In vivo studies showed that new bone penetrated into the pores and directly bonded to the walls within 12weeks after implantation into the femur of Japanese white rabbits. The percentage bone affinity indices of the chemical- and heat-treated porous bodies were significantly higher than that of untreated implants.},

abstract = {Metallic biomaterials are widely used to restore the lost structure and functions of human bone. Due to the large number of joint replacements, there is a growing demand for new and improved orthopedic implants. More specifically, there is a need for novel load-bearing metallic implants with low effective modulus matching that of bone in order to reduce stress shielding and consequently increase the in vivo lifespan of the implant. In this study, we have fabricated porous Ti6Al4V alloy structures, using laser engineered net shaping (LENS), to demonstrate that advanced manufacturing techniques such as LENS can be used to fabricate low-modulus, tailored porosity implants with a wide variety of metals/alloys, where the porosity can be designed in areas based on the patient's need to enhance biological fixation and achieve long-term in vivo stability. The effective modulus of Ti6Al4V alloy structures has been tailored between 7 and 60 GPa and porous Ti alloy structures containing 23-32 vol.{\%} porosity showed modulus equivalent to human cortical bone. In vivo behavior of porous Ti6Al4V alloy samples in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 16 weeks demonstrated a significant increase in calcium within the implants, indicating excellent biological tissue ingrowth through interconnected porosity. In vivo results also showed that total amount of porosity plays an important role in tissue ingrowth.},

@article{Lindner2011,
abstract = {The additive manufacturing technique selective laser melting (SLM) has been successfully proved to be suitable for applications in implant manufacturing. SLM is well known for metal parts and offers direct manufacturing of three-dimensional (3D) parts with high bulk density on the base of individual 3D data, including computer tomography models of anatomical structures. Furthermore, an interconnecting porous structure with defined and reproducible pore size can be integrated during the design of the 3D virtual model of the implant. The objective of this study was to develop the SLM processes for a biodegradable composite material made of $\beta$-tricalcium phosphate ($\beta$-TCP) and poly(D, L)-lactide (PDLLA). The development of a powder composite material ($\beta$-TCP/PDLLA) suitable for the SLM process was successfully performed. The microstructure of the manufactured samples exhibit a homogeneous arrangement of ceramic and polymer. The four-point bending strength was up to 23 MPa. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples confirmed $\beta$-TCP as the only present crystalline phase and the gel permeations chromatography (GPC) analysis documented a degradation of the polymer caused by the laser process less than conventional manufacturing processes. We conclude that SLM presents a new possibility to manufacture individual biodegradable implants made of $\beta$-TCP/PDLLA. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:, 2011.},

From 2004 until today twelve consecutive patients have been operated on successfully according to this treatment plan. Titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) were used to manufacture the implants. The treatment algorithm is proved to be reliable. No corrections had to be performed either to the skull bone or to the implant.

abstract = {In this study, the unit cell approach, which has previously been demonstrated as a method of manufacturing porous components suitable for use as orthopedic implants, has been further developed to include randomized structures. These random structures may aid the bone in-growth process because of their similarity in appearance to trabecular bone and are shown to carry legacy properties that can be related back to the original unit cell on which they are ultimately based. In addition to this, it has been shown that randomization improves the mechanical properties of regular unit cell structures, resulting in anticipated improvements to both implant functionality and longevity. The study also evaluates the effect that a post process sinter cycle has on the components, outlines the improved mechanical properties that are attainable, and also the changes in both the macro and microstructure that occur.},

abstract = {Purpose –The aim of this study is to develop a novel two-laser beam stereolithography system which has the advantages of low cost, fabrication time reduction and high accuracy. Design/methodology/approach –The wavelengths of the two semiconductor laser beams are determined to be 405 nm (blue light) and 532 nm (green light), respectively, according to the relative absorbance rate of the visible-light curable resin (NAF202) used. The blue light laser is suitable for scanning the contour of objects because of its fast absorbance, thus giving a narrow cured depth. The green light laser is better suited to scanning the internal crosshatch to condense the fabrication time because of its deep penetration and its high power results in a wide cured width. A photoabsorber, carbon powder with an average diameter of 0.1 µm, is adopted to control the cured layer thickness. An adaptive crosshatch technique is introduced and applied to the fabrication process. Two benchmarks are proposed and fabricated using the developed system to evaluate the fabrication capability. Furthermore, a coordinate measuring machine is employed to evaluate the accuracy of the fabricated benchmark parts. Findings –An optimal weight percentage of 1.5 is specified. The technique developed in this study is feasible for the fabrication of highly-convoluted objects such as fan blades. The inclusion of the adaptive crosshatch technique in the developed system significantly reduces the fabrication time. Originality/value –The results show that the developed system can fabricate objects quickly with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Metallic biomaterials currently in use for load-bearing orthopedic applications are mostly bioinert and therefore lack sufficient osseointegration. Although bioactive ceramics such as hydroxyapatite (HA) can spontaneously bond to living bone tissue, low fracture toughness of HA limits their use as a bone substitute for load-bearing applications. Surface modifications techniques such as HA coating on metals are current options to improve osseointegration in load-bearing metal implants. Over the last few decades researchers have attempted to find a bioactive metal with high mechanical strength and excellent fatigue resistance that can bond chemically with surrounding bone for orthopedic applications. Recent in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies demonstrated that tantalum is a promissing metal that is bioactive. However, tantalum applications in biomedical devices have been limited by processing challenges rather than biological performances. In this article, we provide an overview of processing aspects and biological performances. In this article, we provide an overview of processing aspects and biological properties of tantalum for load-bearing orthopedic applications.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that certain biomaterials with specific porous structures can induce bone formation in non-osseous sites without the need for osteoinductive biomolecules, however, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon (intrinsic osteoinduction of biomaterials) remain unclear. In particular, to our knowledge the type of pore structure suitable for osteoinduction has not been reported in detail. In the present study we investigated the effects of interconnective pore size on osteoinductivity and the bone formation processes during osteoinduction. Selective laser melting was employed to fabricate porous Ti implants (diameter 3.3mm, length 15 mm) with a channel structure comprising four longitudinal square channels, representing pores, of different diagonal widths, 500, 600, 900, and 1200 $\mu$m (termed p500, p600, p900, and p1200, respectively). These were then subjected to chemical and heat treatments to induce bioactivity. Significant osteoinduction was observed in p500 and p600, with the highest observed osteoinduction occurring at 5mm from the end of the implants. A distance of 5mm probably provides a favorable balance between blood circulation and fluid movement. Thus, the simple architecture of the implants allowed effective investigation of the influence of the interconnective pore size on osteoinduction, as well as the relationship between bone quantity and its location for different pore sizes.},

abstract = {A major challenge in tissue engineering is the generation of cell-seeded implants with structures that mimic native tissue, both in anatomic geometries and intratissue cell distributions. By combining the strengths of injection molding tissue engineering with those of solid freeform fabrication (SFF), three-dimensional (3-D) pre-seeded implants were fabricated without custom-tooling, enabling efficient production of patient-specific implants. The incorporation of SFF technology also enabled the fabrication of geometrically complex, multiple-material implants with spatially heterogeneous properties that would otherwise be challenging to produce. Utilizing a custom-built robotic SFF platform and gel deposition tools, alginate hydrogel was used with calcium sulfate as a crosslinking agent to produce pre-seeded living implants of arbitrary geometries. The process was determined to be sterile and viable at 94 +/- 5{\%}. The GAG and hydroxyproline production was found to be similar to that of other implants fabricated using the same materials with different shaping methods. The geometric fidelity of the process was quantified by using the printing platform as a computerized measurement machine (CMM); the RMS surface roughness of printed samples in the z-dimension was found to be 0.16 +/- 0.02 mm.},

abstract = {An effective and novel technique for improving the biocompatibility of a biograde 316 LS stainless steel through the application of CO(2) laser treatment to modify the surface properties of the material is described herein. Different surface properties, such as surface roughness, surface oxygen content, and surface energy for CO(2) laser-treated 316 LS stainless steel, untreated, and mechanically roughened samples were analyzed, and their effects on the wettability characteristics of the material were studied. It was found that modification of the wettability characteristics of the 316 LS stainless steel following CO(2) laser treatment was achieved. This improvement was identified as being mainly due to the change in the polar component of the surface energy. One-day cell adhesion tests showed that cells not only adhered and spread better, but also grew faster on the CO(2) laser-treated sample than on either the untreated or mechanically roughened sample. Further, compared with the untreated sample, MTT cell proliferation analysis revealed that the mechanically roughed surface resulted in a slight enhancement, and CO(2) laser treatment brought about a significant increase in cell proliferation. An increase in the wettability of the 316 LS stainless steel was observed to positively correlate with the cell proliferation.},

abstract = {Porous surfaces are intended to enhance osteointegration of cementless implants. Tantalum has been introduced in an effort to enhance osseointegration potential of uncemented components. We therefore compared the clinical outcome of acetabular components with two different porous surfaces. We retrospectively reviewed 283 patients (295 hips) who underwent cementless revision hip arthroplasty with either an HA-coated titanium cup (207 patients, 214 hips) or porous tantalum cup (79 patients, 81 hips). The minimum followup was 24 months in both groups (titanium: average 51.8 months, range, 24-98 months; tantalum: average, 35.4 months, range, 24-63 months). The titanium and tantalum groups had a mechanical failure rate (clinical plus radiographic) of 8{\%} and 6{\%}, respectively. In hips with minor bone deficiency (type 1, 2A, 2B using the classification of Paprosky et al.), 6{\%} of titanium cups and 4{\%} of tantalum cups failed. In hips with major bone deficiency (type 2C, 3), 24{\%} of titanium cups and 12{\%} of tantalum cups developed failure. In the major bone deficiency group, the tantalum cups had fewer numbers of lucent zones around the cup. Eighty-two percent of titanium cups that failed did so at 6 months postoperatively or later, whereas 80{\%} of tantalum cups that failed did so in less than 6 months. Radiographically in the major group, tantalum cups yielded better fixation. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

@article{Kokubo2004,
abstract = {Some ceramics, such as Bioglass, sintered hydroxyapatite, and glass-ceramic A-W, spontaneously form a bone-like apatite layer on their surface in the living body, and bond to bone through the apatite layer. These materials are called bioactive ceramics, and are clinically important for use as bone-repairing materials. However, they cannot be used at high-load sites, such as is found in femoral and tibial bones, because their fracture toughness values are not as high as that of human cortical bone. Titanium metal and its alloys have high fracture toughness, and form a sodium titanate layer on its surface when soaked in a 5 M-NaOH solution at 60 degrees C for 24 h, followed by a heat treatment at 600 degrees C for 1 h. On moving toward the metal interior, the sodium titanate layer gradually changes into the pure metal within a distance of 1 microm from the surface. The mechanical strength of the titanium metal or a titanium alloy is not adversely affected by these chemical and thermal treatments. The titanium metal and its alloys resulting from the above treatment can release Na+ ions from its surface into a surrounding body fluid via an ion exchange reaction with H3O+ ions, resulting in many Ti-OH groups forming on its surface. These Ti-OH groups initially combine with Ca2+ ions to form amorphous calcium titanate in the body environment, and later the calcium titanate combines with phosphate ions to form amorphous calcium phosphate. The amorphous calcium phosphate eventually transforms into bone-like apatite, and by this process the titanium metals are soon tightly bonded to the surrounding living bone through the bone-like apatite layer. The treated metals have already been subjected to clinical trials for applications in artificial total hip joints. Metallic tantalum has also been found to bond to living bone after it has been subjected to the NaOH and heat treatment to form a sodium tantalate layer on its surface.},

abstract = {Bionanocomposites formed by combining biodegradable polymers and nanosized osteoconductive inorganic solids have been regarded as promising biomimetic systems which possess much improved structural and functional properties for bone tissue regeneration. In this study three-dimensional nanocomposite scaffolds based on calcium phosphate (Ca-P)/poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHAp)/poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanocomposite microspheres were successfully fabricated using selective laser sintering, which is a rapid prototyping technology. The sintered scaffolds had controlled material microstructure, totally interconnected porous structure and high porosity. The morphology and mechanical properties of Ca-P/PHBV and CHAp/PLLA nanocomposite scaffolds as well as PHBV and PLLA polymer scaffolds were studied. In vitro biological evaluation showed that SaOS-2 cells had high cell viability and normal morphology and phenotype after 3 and 7days culture on all scaffolds. The incorporation of Ca-P nanoparticles significantly improved cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity for Ca-P/PHBV scaffolds, whereas CHAp/PLLA nanocomposite scaffolds exhibited a similar level of cell response compared with PLLA polymer scaffolds. The nanocomposite scaffolds provide a biomimetic environment for osteoblastic cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation and have great potential for bone tissue engineering applications.},

@article{Hutmacher2001,
abstract = {A number of different processing techniques have been developed to design and fabricate three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. The imperfection of the current techniques has encouraged the use of a rapid prototyping technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1{\%} and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomb-like pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 microm. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1{\%} offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1{\%} offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degrees C) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. In comparison, the scaffolds with a 0/72/144/36/108 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1{\%} offset yield strength in air of 20.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1{\%} offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degrees C) of 21.5 +/- 2.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1{\%} offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p < or = 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the 1st culturing week. Over a period of 3-4 weeks in a culture, the fully interconnected scaffold architecture was completely 3D-filled by cellular tissue. Our cell culture study shows that fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells can proliferate, differentiate, and produce a cellular tissue in an entirely interconnected 3D polycaprolactone matrix.},

abstract = {We present a novel route for producing a new class of titanium foams for use in biomedical implant applications. These foams are hierarchically porous, with both the traditional large (>300mum) highly interconnected pores and, uniquely, wall struts also containing micron scale (0.5-5mum) interconnected porosities. The fabrication method consists of first producing a porous oxide precursor via a gel casting method, followed by electrochemical reduction to produce a metallic foam. This method offers the unique ability to tailor the porosity at several scales independently, unlike traditional space-holder techniques. Reducing the pressure during foam setting increased the macro-pore size. The intra-strut pore size (and percentage) can be controlled independently of macro-pore size by altering the ceramic loading and sintering temperature during precursor production. Typical properties for an 80{\%} porous Ti foam were a modulus of approximately 1GPa, a yield strength of 8MPa, a permeability of 350 Darcies, all of which are in the range required for biomedical implant applications. We also demonstrate that the micron scale intra-strut porosities can be exploited to allow infiltration of bioactive materials using a novel bioactive silica-polymer composite, resulting in a metal-bioactive silica-polymer composite.},

abstract = {In this report, we present a prototype design of a quadrupole mass filter (QMF) with hyperbolic electrodes, fabricated at the University of Liverpool using digital light processing (DLP), a low-cost and lightweight 3D rapid prototyping (RP) technique. Experimental mass spectra are shown for H(2)(+), D(2)(+), and He(+) ions to provide proof of principle that the DLP mass filter is working as a mass analyzer in the low-mass range (1 to 10 amu). The performance of the DLP QMF has also been investigated for individual spectral peaks. Numerical simulations of the instrument were performed by coupling CPO and Liverpool QMS-2 programs to model both the ion source and mass filter, respectively, and the instrument is shown to perform as predicted by theory. DLP thus allows miniaturization of mass spectrometers at low cost, using hyperbolic (or other) geometries of mass analyzer electrodes that provide optimal ion manipulation and resolution for a given application. The potential of using RP fabrication techniques for developing miniature and microscale mass analyzers is also discussed.},

@article{Carpinteri2004a,
abstract = {In a previous paper Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 191 (2001) 3, the framework for the mechanics of solids, deformable over fractal subsets, was outlined. Anomalous mechanical quantities with fractal dimensions were introduced, i.e. the fractal stress, the fractal strain and the fractal work of deformation. By means of the local fractional operators, the static and kinematic equations were obtained, and the principle of virtual work for fractal media was demonstrated. In this paper, the constitutive equations of fractal elasticity are put forward. From the definition of the fractal elastic potential, the linear elastic constitutive relation is derived. The physical dimensions of the second derivatives of the elastic potential depend on the fractal dimensions of both stress and strain. Thereby, the elastic constants undergo positive or negative scaling, depending on the topological character of deformation patterns and stress flux. The direct formulation of elastic equilibrium is derived in terms of the fractional Lam operators and of the equivalence equations at the boundary. The variational form of the elastic problem is also obtained, through minimization of the total potential energy. Finally, discretization of the fractal medium is proposed, in the spirit of the RitzGalerkin approach, and a finite element formulation is obtained by means of devils staircase interpolating splines.},

It is shown that the fractal dimension has a strong influence on the rising of the R-curve in brittle materials. For the unstable Griffith-Mott's approach or dynamical crack growth the fractal dimension has a strong influence on the velocity limit of the crack growth. It is also shown that the limit of crack velocity lowers with increasing surface ruggedness (higher fractal dimension D = 2 - H) explaining the intangibility of the Rayleigh wave velocity by the cracks.

abstract = {Evaluating a fractal curve's "approximate length" by walking a compass defines a "compass exponent." Long ago, I showed that for a self-similar curve (e.g., a model of coastline), the compass exponent coincides with all the other forms of the fractal dimension, e.g., the similarity, box or mass dimensions. Now walk a compass along a self-affine curve, such as a scalar Brownian record B(t). It will be shown that a full description in terms of fractal dimension is complex. Each version of dimension has a local and a global value, separated by a crossover. First finding: the basic methods of evaluating the global fractal dimension yield 1: globally, a self-affine fractal behaves as it if were not fractal. Second finding: the box and mass dimensions are 1.5, but the compass dimension is D = 2. More generally, for a fractional Bownian record BH(t), (e.g., a model of vertical cuts of relief), the global fractal dimensions are 1, several local fractal dimensions are 2-H, and the compass dimension is 1/H. This 1/H is the fractal dimension of a self-similar fractal trail, whose definition was already implicit in the definition of the record of BH(t).},

abstract = {THE PRINCIPLE of maximum energy dissipation rate is introduced as an energy criterion for crack dynamics. That allows us to explain observed limiting crack speeds in brittle materials, and to complete the crack dynamics formulation. The upper limits of the crack speed in perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic bodies are obtained. It is found that the theoretical maximum crack speed in an isotropic elastic body (in the first mode of crack propagation) is approximately equal to half the shear wave speed. In the case of an elastic-plastic body, the criterion is formulated as a maximum plastic strain work per unit time. The self-similar problem for the fracture mode III is solved (assuming the plastic zone to be narrow) and the crack speed limit is found as a function of the ratio of loading to yield limit: the plasticity decreases the crack speed limit and the latter tends to zero with the yield limit. The comparison of these theoretical results with some experimental data shows that under ordinary conditions crack propagation appears to conform to the ''maximum dissipation rate'' process.},

This paper is limited to a demonstration of the method which is applied to a few metal cyclopentadienyl compounds, plus specific emphasis on the U(III) metallocene (CpSiMe(3))(3)U-AlCp* recently prepared by Arnold and co-workers(15) having no experimental bond energies available. It is shown that computed bond energies of pertinent metallocyclopentadieneyls are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. Calculated bond energies for all essential bonds in the uranium metallocene cited above are provided together with a further analysis of the bonding and magnetic properties of this unique compound.},

The new model incorporates all previously considered theories of fracture processes, in particular the Griffith Griffith AA. The phenomenon of rupture and flow in solids. Philos Trans Roy Soc Lond 1921;A221:163-398 theory, its contemporary extension known as LEFM and the most recently developed Quantized Fracture Mechanics (QFM) by Pugno and Ruoff Pugno N, Ruoff RS. Quantized fracture mechanics. Philos Mag 2004;84(27):2829-45. Using an equivalent smooth blunt crack for a given fractal crack, we find that assuming that radius of curvature of the blunt crack is a material property, the crack roughens while propagating. In other words, fractal dimension at the crack tip is a monotonically increasing function of the nominal crack length, i.e., the presence of the Mirror-Mist-Hackle phenomenon is analytically demonstrated.

abstract = {In this paper,we use an extended form of the finite element method to study failure in polycrystalline microstructures. Quasi-static crack propagation is conducted using the extended finite element method (X-FEM) and microstructures are simulated using a kinetic Monte Carlo Potts algorithm. In the X-FEM, the framework of partition of unity is used to enrich the classical finite element approximation with a discontinuous function and the two-dimensional asymptotic crack-tip fields. This enables the domain to be modeled by finite elements without explicitly meshing the crack surfaces, and hence crack growth simulations can be carried out without the need for remeshing. First, the convergence of the method for crack problems is studied and its rate of convergence is established. Microstructural calculations are carried out on a regular lattice and a constrained Delaunay triangulation algorithm is used to mesh the microstructure. Fracture properties of the grain boundaries are assumed to be distinct from that of the grain interior, and the maximum energy release rate criterion is invoked to study the competition between intergranular and transgranular modes of crack growth. Mathematical subject classification: 74R10. Key words: microstructure, grain boundaries, crack discontinuity, partition of unity, extended},

@article{Taylor2005,
abstract = {This paper describes a modification to the traditional Griffith energy balance as used in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The modification involves using a finite amount of crack extension (Deltaa) instead of an infinitesimal extension (da) when calculating the energy release rate. We propose to call this method finite fracture mechanics (FFM). This leads to a change in the Griffith equation for brittle fracture, introducing a new term Deltaa/2: we denote this length as L and assume that it is a material constant. This modification is extremely useful because it allows LEFM to be used to make predictions in two situations in which it is normally invalid: short cracks and notches. It is shown that accurate predictions can be made of both brittle fracture and fatigue behaviour for short cracks and notches in a range of different materials. The value of L can be expressed as a function of two other material constants: the fracture toughness K-c (or threshold DeltaK(th) in the case of fatigue) and an inherent strength parameter sigma(0). For the particular cases of fatigue-limit prediction in metals and brittle fracture in ceramics, it is shown that sigma(0) coincides directly with the ultimate tensile strength (or, in fatigue, the fatigue limit), as measured on plain, unnotched specimens. For brittle fracture in polymers and metals, in which larger amounts of plasticity precede fracture, the approach can still be used but sigma(0) takes on a different value, higher than the plain-specimen strength, which can be found from experimental data. Predictions can be made very easily for any problem in which the stress intensity factor, K is known as a function of crack length. Furthermore, it is shown that the predictions of this method, FFM, are similar to those of a method known as the line method (LM) in which failure is predicted based on the average stress along a line drawn ahead of the crack or notch.

The following important essential ingredients in computational dynamic fracture mechanics are included: (i) fundamental aspects of dynamic fracture mechanics, (ii) types of fracture simulation, (iii) computational models of dynamic crack propagation, and (iv) use of dynamic J-integral in computational models. In item (i), special attention is focused on the asymptotic eigen fields for various states of dynamic crack tips, which provide the foundation of dynamic fracture mechanics asWilliams asymptotic eigen solutions provided the foundation of static linear fracturemechanics. In item(ii), a new concept ofmixed-phase simulation is presented for general nonself-similar crack propagation, in addition to the generation-phase and application-phase simulations. A comprehensive summary of computational models for dynamic crack propagation is given in item (iii). Finally, in item (iv), several attractive features of the dynamic J-integral are presented.},

@article{Mandelbrot1984,
abstract = {When a piece of metal is fractured either by tensile or impact loading (pulling or hitting), the fracture surface that is formed is rough and irregular. Its shape is affected by the metal's microstructure (such as grains, inclusions and precipitates, whose characteristic length is large relative to the atomic scale), as well as by 'macrostructural' influences (such as the size, the shape of the specimen, and the notch from which the fracture begins). However, repeated observation at various magnifications also reveals a variety of additional structures that fall between the 'micro' and the 'macro' and have not yet been described satisfactorily in a systematic manner. The experiments reported here reveal the existence of broad and clearly distinct zone of intermediate scales in which the structure is modelled very well by a fractal surface. A new method, slit island analysis, is introduced to estimate the basic quantity called the fractal dimension, D. The estimate is shown to agree with the value obtained by fracture profile analysis, a spectral method. Finally, D is shown to be a measure of toughness in metals.},

@article{Adda-Bedia1999,
abstract = {We use Eshelby's energy momentum tensor of dynamic elasticity to compute the forces acting on a moving crack front in a three-dimensional elastic solid [Philos. Mag. 42, 1401 (1951)]. The crack front is allowed to be any curve in three dimensions, but its curvature is assumed small enough so that near the front the dynamics is locally governed by two-dimensional physics. In this case the component of the elastic force on the crack front that is tangent to the front vanishes. However, both the other components, parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion, do not vanish. We propose that the dynamics of cracks that are allowed to deviate from straight line motion is governed by a vector equation that reflects a balance of elastic forces with dissipative forces at the crack tip, and a phenomenological model for those dissipative forces is advanced. Under certain assumptions for the parameters that characterize the model for the dissipative forces, we find a second order dynamic instability for the crack trajectory. This is signaled by the existence of a critical velocity V(c) such that for velocities V<V(c) the motion is governed by K(II)=0, while for V>V(c) it is governed by K(II) not equal to 0. This result provides a qualitative explanation for some experimental results associated with dynamic fracture instabilities in thin brittle plates. When deviations from straight line motion are suppressed, the usual equation of straight line crack motion based on a Griffiths-like criterion is recovered.},

We then show that there is always an upper bound to roughness, i.e. a propagating fractal crack reaches a terminal roughness. We then study the phenomenon of reaching a terminal velocity. Assuming that propagation of a fractal crack is discrete, we predict its terminal velocity using an asymptotic energy balance argument.

abstract = {Fractals and surfaces are two of the most widely-studied areas of modern physics. In fact, most surfaces in nature are fractals. In this book, Drs. Barab si and Stanley explain how fractals can be successfully used to describe and predict the morphology of surface growth. The authors begin by presenting basic growth models and the principles used to develop them. They next demonstrate how models can be used to answer specific questions about surface roughness. In the second half of the book, they discuss in detail two classes of phenomena: fluid flow in porous media and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In each case, the authors review the model and analytical approach, and present experimental results. This book is the first attempt to unite the subjects of fractals and surfaces, and it will appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. Because of the technological importance of MBE, it will also be of interest to scientists, particularly materials scientists, working in industry and research. Interested readers may view a sample chapter by contacting our web site at http://www.cup.org/onlinepubs/Fractals/fracts1.html.},

abstract = {The scaling laws describing the roughness development of crack surfaces are incorporated into the Griffith criterion. We show that, in the case of a Family-Vicsek scaling, the energy balance leads to a purely elastic brittle behavior. On the contrary, it appears that an anomalous scaling reflects a R-curve behavior associated to a size effect of the critical resistance to crack growth in agreement with the fracture process of heterogeneous brittle materials exhibiting a microcracking damage.},

@article{Rice1996,
abstract = {We summarize studies of earthquake fault models that give rise to slip complexities like those in natural earthquakes. For models of smooth faults between elastically deformable continua, it is critical that the friction laws involve a characteristic distance for slip weakening or evolution of surface state. That results in a finite nucleation size, or coherent slip patch size, h*. Models of smooth faults, using numerical cell size properly small compared to h*, show periodic response or complex and apparently chaotic histories of large events but have not been found to show small event complexity like the self-similar (power law) Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size statistics. This conclusion is supported in the present paper by fully inertial elastodynamic modeling of earthquake sequences. In contrast, some models of locally heterogeneous faults with quasi-independent fault segments, represented approximately by simulations with cell size larger than h* so that the model becomes "inherently discrete," do show small event complexity of the Gutenberg-Richter type. Models based on classical friction laws without a weakening length scale or for which the numerical procedure imposes an abrupt strength drop at the onset of slip have h* = 0 and hence always fall into the inherently discrete class. We suggest that the small-event complexity that some such models show will not survive regularization of the constitutive description, by inclusion of an appropriate length scale leading to a finite h*, and a corresponding reduction of numerical grid size.},
